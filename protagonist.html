        <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight:900; text-transform:uppercase">Protagonist</span> is a voice-controlled experience for the Google Home that responds to the growing segment of audio-only interactive media. It plays to the strengths of audio recognition and analysis to transform passive listening into immersive engagement.</p>
        <p>When prompted, users use their voice to respond to other characters in a story and subsequently affect the narrative arc, depending on how they respond. Think of it like an extension of <a href="https://goosebumps.scholastic.com/books" target="_blank">Goosebumps</a>, or more recently, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Mirror:_Bandersnatch" target="_blank">Bandersnatch</a>.</p>
        <p>Users can give open-ended responses, which are analyzed for content and emotional qualities to choose which narrative path should be taken. This differs from existing choose-your-own-adventure media in that the user is not restricted to selecting from a predefined list of options, but rather can be expressive in their response and let the algorithm sort out the rest.</p>
        <blockquote>* Please note that this is a technical specification write-up! It's more meant for the eyes of a developer. However, I believe it showcases the level of detail I use to document projects.</blockquote>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation ">
        <h3>Overall user experience</h3>
        <h5>Vocal entry point</h5>
        <p>A user can enter the experience by saying ‚ÄúHey Google, open <span class="var">Protagonist</span>‚Äù. A minimal orchestral soundtrack signifies that the experience is beginning... ‚ÄùWelcome to Protagonist‚Äù, a hushed voice says. ‚ÄúWould you like to continue your last story or search for something new?‚Äù If the user wants to begin a new story, they vocally navigate a menu that sorts stories into genres and eventually pick one by saying the name of the story (see <a href="#menunav">menu navigation</a> for specifics). </p>
        <p>A user can also enter the experience by avoiding the menu, and selecting a specific known story. They might say ‚ÄúHey Google, go to Camp Nightmare‚Äù. If the user chooses a specific story, it begins immediately playing the introduction to the story, bypassing the normal product introduction.</p>
      </div>



      <div class="grid-1 has-animation image-next">
        <h5>App entry point</h5>
        <p>A user can also trigger a story through their Google Home app (Figure 1), by navigating to the browse tab and tapping on the story.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="has-animation">

      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation" id="ideation">
        <h5>Bulk of the experience</h5>
        <p>The bulk of the experience is the user listening to the story and responding to prompts. If the user is playing Goosebumps: Camp Nightmare, a reimagination of a Goosebumps classic, it might begin like...</p>
        <blockquote >
          <p><i class="fas fa-volume-up"></i><br>A schoolbus is shaking and churning as it barrels down a highway, the excited chatter and laughter of children hanging in the air like a warm cloud.</p>
          <p><span class="heavy">Narrator<br></span> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a cold Autumn morning, and you and your friends are on your way to a school camping trip...‚Äù</p>
          <p><span class="heavy">Dori, one of the characters<br></span> My cousin told me not to wander off into the woods while we‚Äôre out camping. She said there‚Äôs ghosts out there. Do you believe in ghosts?</p>
          <p><span class="heavy">User, responding with voice<br></span> Hmm, I don‚Äôt really believe in them.</p>
          <p><span class="heavy">Dori<br></span> What! My cousin says she‚Äôs seen them out there. If you look for long enough you can see their red eyes between the trees.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>In this scenario, the program is listening for an affirmative or negative response. But the response doesn‚Äôt have to be as binary as ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù‚Äìnatural language processing picks out the general sentiment and keywords to classify the response given by the user, and then select the appropriate next piece of the story. For specifics on the algorithm that performs this function, jump to <a href="#algorithm">decision nodes</a>.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation image-next">
        <h5 id="menunav">Menu navigation</h5>
        <p>In order to select a story in the audio-only interface, the user must be able to browse a potentially large database of content with only their voice. Upon starting, Protagonist asks if the user would like to resume a story or browse story genres. If the user says browse, then Protagonist lists off the first five available genres, like ‚ÄúAdventure‚Äù or ‚ÄúMystery‚Äù, and asks if the user would like to hear more genres, if they are available. The user can select a genre by saying its name. This minimizes cognitive load and follows best-practice guidelines on menu navigation in audio interfaces.</p>
      </div>

      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation ">
        <p>Upon selection of a genre, Protagonist lists off the first five stories available and asks if the user wants to select one, hear more about one, or list off the next 5 available stories.</p>
        <p>The user can select a story by saying its name, or can request to ‚Äúhear more about ____‚Äù for a brief audio description of what the story is about.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation">
        <h5>Exiting the experience</h5>
        <p>A user can ask Google to pause, play, or quit a story. This could be as simple as saying ‚ÄúGoogle, play / pause / quit‚Äù, but we can also extend the natural language processing to map to these functions‚Äìa user might say ‚Äústop‚Äù, ‚Äúend‚Äù, or ‚Äúfinish‚Äù, all of which are semantically similar to ‚Äúquit‚Äù. When the user returns, the story will resume from where it left off.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation image-next" >
        <h5>Context of use</h5>
        <p>Protagonist is designed to work in the home setting, with a Google smart speaker device located in the same room as the user. The experience can be similarly extended to a mobile-only experience, but we will focus first on the in-home experience since it is more socially acceptable to vocally engage with a story in a private setting.</p>

        <h2>Architecture of a story</h2>
      </div>

      <div class="has-animation">
        <img style="margin-top:15px; width:100%" data-src="img/protagonist/architecture.jpg" alt="Experiential prototyping with kids" data-action="zoom" class="lazy big-image">
        <p class="caption">Fig 4. Abstracted view of modules that make up a story.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation ">
        <h5>Story</h5>
        <p>A story is the top-level wrapper for a complete narrative structure, which the user can navigate end-to-end. It is comprised primarily of content, prompts & responses, decision nodes, and branches. Figure 4 outlines the architecture of a story.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation " >
        <h5>Content</h5>
        <p>Content is the bulk of the story, taking the form of .wav files that are supplied by the content creator. Content is static and non-interactive, and is simply played back to the user through the Google Home‚Äôs built-in speaker. Content is up to the content creator, but is likely to contain character dialogue, ambient sounds, and musical scores that help to create an immersive story.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation " >
        <h5>Prompts</h5>
        <p>Once the story reaches a point at which the user can interact with the narrative, they are given a prompt. Prompts are questions that are posed to the user, typically by the story narrator or by another character in the story, and are immediately followed by an audio cue that informs the user that they can speak to enter an input (see sound design section). Prompts are supplied by content creators, as they are specific to the narrative in which they exist. </p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation " >
        <h5>Responses</h5>
        <p>Responses are user-provided voice inputs that occur directly after a prompt is given. These are the inputs that are processed via the text-to-speech -> NLU pipeline. They can take any form that the user chooses, which introduces potential problems in recognition and content analysis issues. For specific directions in error recovery and response analysis, see Section VI.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation " >
        <h5>Decision nodes</h5>
        <p>Decision nodes are the points at which a story diverges into two or more different directions, or ‚Äúbranches‚Äù. Which branch is taken depends on the output of the response analyzing algorithms. See Section V for an in-depth explanation of the types of nodes and their algorithms.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation " >
        <h5>Branches</h5>
        <p>Branches are the different paths taken throughout a story. One decision node can lead to one or more separate branches.</p>

        <p>Ultimately we moved forward with the trebuchet. We knew that it was engaging for kids, and that the educational aspect was valid, but that one of our larger design challenges would be securing stakeholder buy-in. We also were unsure

        <p>The teacher suggested that we incorporate specific goals for students to achieve in order to make the experiment more guided. We used this feedback to develop a set of challenges in the digital interface.</p>

        <h5>AUTOMATED DATA TRACKING</h5>
        <p>Every time a projectile is launched, the interface automatically calculates the kinetic energy and graphs it in the data tracker. Minimal manual input lets students focus on identifying trends, not rote recording.</p>

        <h5>TARGETED CHALLENGES</h5>
        <p>We found through classroom testing that students need specific goals so that the play-learning is structured. Asking them to hit certain criteria with their tests encourages critial thinking and pattern recognition.</p>

        <h5>LOW-COST SETUP</h5>
        <p>Not including the Arduino and computer, this 3-student group activity is made from classroom materials. The main components are a $5 accelerometer and printed cardstock templates. It costs ~$4 per student.</p>

        <h2 id="reflection">Reflecting on the experience</h2>
        <p>Designing with such a tight set of constraints gave our team the ability to rapidly ideate, downselect, and test our concepts and assumptions. We were always able to fall back on a set of key questions‚Äìis this achieving our desired
          NGSS standard? Will this cost less than $10 per student? Would this work in a classroom?</p>
        <p>Possibly the most difficult aspect was meeting the needs of multiple stakeholders‚Äìteachers, students, and Microsoft Education would sometimes give clashing feedback. Our use of prototypes‚Äìfrom behavioral, to video, to functional,
          varied according to the particular stakeholder, and allowed us to triangulate design insights through our interactions with each party.</p>

          <h4>La fin</h4>
          <p>Woohoo! During a showcase at Microsoft in Redmond, WA, we won an award for the "best technical implementation". Thanks to my great teammates Sakshat Goyal and Javan Wang, and also to advisors Michael Smith and Jon Froehlich.</p>
