    <p class="subhead">The challenge
    <p>
    <h3>Before we had a system, cards were a wild west at <a href="https://joinhandshake.com/">Handshake</a>.</h3>
    <h3>Design cycles were spent re-hashing the same decisions; developers kept implementing their own components. Cards
        were expensive to build and maintain.</h3>

    <h3>What's more – we had an upcoming product launch for a new social media feed product that would be made almost
        completely from content cards.

        <h3>We needed a system to make the design and development of cards easy and consistent that worked for web and
            native mobile platforms.</h3>

        <p class="subhead">My role
        <p>
        <h3>I worked as the design lead to unify our approach to cards into a systematic yet flexible framework,
            coordinating with 3 different teams of product designers, PMs, and engineers to align on a system proposal
            and translate it into the live product.</h3>

        <p class="subhead">The work
        <p>
        <h3>As the lead on Handshake's design systems team, I saw firsthand the wide range of cards being discussed in
            design reviews and critiques, and proposed a project to come up with a unified system.</h3>
        <p>I took charge on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Auditing our existing cards and competitive examples</li>
            <li>Exploring potential card systems</li>
            <li>Visual and interaction design of the components</li>
            <li>Moving the work through multiple leadership reviews</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I built off early card designs that various product designers had explored for their respective product
            areas, and worked with them to present the work to leadership. I led a series of roadshow presentations with
            a number of feature teams to get more buy-in for the system.</p>

        <figcaption>I meticulously annotated decisions and worked with engineering to codify them into the component.

        <h3>The outcome: simplified decision making, a successful Feed launch, cheaper card implementations, and greater
            product polish & consistency.</h3>

        <p>The card system simplifies decision-making when introducing new card variants, and creates reusable
            components that reduces the time spent during eng implementation. The new cards are in use today across web,
            iOS, and Android.</p>
        <p>These cards were included in the launch of Handshake's Feed product, which bumped our weekly active users by
            >300% for participating universities, and is scheduled for a wider launch in February 2024.</p>
        <p>Now, designers are able to take ready-made components and customize them in ways that match the
            implementation in code, which significantly reduces the time it takes to implement experiences that require
            a card component.</p>
        <p>The card system is already being extended and flexed into new use cases across our Employer and School
            products. It speeds up the delivery time significantly for a card by providing a plug-and-play framework for
            designers and developers.</p>

        <h3>Process artifacts</h3>

        <p>I took a rigorous approach to auditing our existing cards, exploring potential directions, and aligning on a
            proposal with feature teams and design & engineering leadership. <u>I’m happy to discuss my process in more
                detail in a conversation–these are just some snippets of artifacts from the design process.</u></p>

        <p>I'd be delighted to walk through the designs and process in more detail in a portfolio review or
