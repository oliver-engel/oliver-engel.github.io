    <h3>I'm passionate about mentorship and making free resources for the design community. I tend to focus on practical, real-world advice that I've developed over my years in design, and release it via files on Figma Community.</h3>
    <h3>So far, I've released 4 files that have been downloaded a combined 15,000+ times. I love the feeling of sharing what I know, particularly with designers who are new to the field.</h3>

    <h3>I designed and coded <a href="https://www.theinterviewkit.com/">theinterviewkit.com</a> from scratch to promote the resource.</h3>
