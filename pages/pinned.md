#### Pinned: a bookmarking microsite

![Pinned site](/assets/img/projects/pinned/site.png)

I made Pinned to curate some of my favorite digital places. Developed as a static site using Jekyll, and hosted on Netlify.

I'm by no means a professional software developer, but I do love doing front-end work. This portfolio you're browsing now was hand coded by me, and I like making microsites as an opportunity to try out new techniques and have fun.
