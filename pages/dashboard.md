##### About Boundless Immigration
[Boundless Immigration](https://www.boundless.com/) is an online service that helps immigrants apply for marriage-based green cards, fiancÃ© visas, and a range of other legal statuses. Customers pair with customer support and an immigration attorney and work with them over 2-3 months to prepare their application.

###### The Challenge

### Our high-touch, multi-month green card application experience took place mostly over email, leading to customer confusion & dissats, high inbound email volume, and longer processing times for all customers.

###### The Product
### I helped design a self-serve dashboard that aimed to better guide customers through the process, speed up processing times, and lower the burden on customer support.

The dashboard led to a 33% decline in inbound customer support emails over the first 5 months after launch, and positive customer & CS team feedback.
