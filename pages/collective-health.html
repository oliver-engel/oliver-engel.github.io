  <h5>Simplify & condense</h5>
  <p>I simultaneously condensed the icons and simplified their details.</p>

  <h3>Translating design system elements</h3>
  <p>I also worked extensively with other design system elements like typography, color, and spacing to help move the mobile app in a direction that aligned with the broader consumer-facing product suite.</p>

  <h3>Other explorations</h3>
  <p>I also had the chance to work on interaction design iterations for a health insurance claim automation tool. I'm unable to show the work publicly, but I'm always happy to share more details about it in a conversation.</p>
