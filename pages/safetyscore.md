###### About Samsara
[Samsara](https://www.samsara.com/) is an enterprise hardware + software platform for connecting physical operations (like vehicles and other assets) to the cloud. I work on Safety, which is an area that uses AI dash cams and other hardware to capture events like speeding, distracted driving, and crashes.

###### The Challenge

### The Safety Score, a highly visible (and sensitive) feature of our highest-ARR product, had low adoption in customer workflows and often required heavy customer support involvement to set up properly.

Safety scores are used to identify which drivers should be coached on safe driving practices, and manifest as a number between 0 and 100.

###### The Product
### I designed a guided onboarding flow and settings overhaul for Safety Scoring, geared towards increasing feature adoption and reducing customer support tickets.

While it's not yet GA'd, the updates have seen relatively rapid adoption in beta as well as positive customer feedback.
