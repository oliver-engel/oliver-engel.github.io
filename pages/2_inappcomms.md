<p class="subhead">01. Setting the stage</p>

### Many of [Boundless Immigration](https://www.boundless.com/)'s touchpoints with customers happen via email, an unstructured and non-scalable way to operate the business.


<div class="content-two-column">
  <p class="has-dropcap">Email is used in just about every piece of the sometimes months-long process, which means our customer service reps were dealing with increasingly clogged inboxes. Tedious back & forth communications often take multiple rounds of emailing to resolve. This reliance on email was untenable for long-term growth.<br><br>The most email-heavy phase of the Boundless process is the <span class="term"><span class="hint--bottom hint--large" aria-label="A phase of the Boundless green card application process where a CS teammember assembles a list of questions and tasks to send to the customer before they can move forward in the process.">QA Return</span></span>. After our team does a complete review of an application, they assemble a list of questions and to-do items for the customer to take care of before moving on to the next phase.</p>

<p class="subhead">02. The Challenge</p>

### Our MVP needed to shift the QA return burden from email into our app, while also laying the foundation for a full in-app comms system.

<div class="content-two-column">
  <p class="has-dropcap">While this project was specifically about bringing the QA returns process into our web experience, the other major goal was creating a UI pattern that can then be extended to other parts of the process.<br><br>We also had the chance to build a new admin UI system from the ground up, again with the goal of making it extensible when more tools are eventually added.</p>
