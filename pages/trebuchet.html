intro: Microsoft Education’s Hacking STEM program combines play and learning through
  Arduino-based activities for kids.
intro-details: For a student project, I worked on a team of 3 to design and code a
  potential new entry to the STEM activity catalog. We won an award for our technical
  implementation.

  <h3>I led the user experience and front-end development for a digital data dashboard that pulled data from an accelerometer.</h3>

  <p>My team and I worked with kids and teachers to develop and iterate on both digital and physical components of a STEM education kit. We recieved an award for Best Technical Implementation during an expo at Microsoft in Redmond, WA.</p>

  <p>Made alongside the talented <a href="https://javanwang.com/">Javan Wang</a> and <a href="http://www.sakshatgoyal.com/">Sakshat Goyal</a>.</p>

  <h3>The challenge</h3>
  <p>"Build an affordable inquiry and project-based activity to visualize data across science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) curriculum."</p>
  <p>Specifically, we were to create an experiment that cost under $10 per student (excluding the Arduino and computer), and that aligned with a <a href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/">Next Generation Science Standard</a>.</p>

  <p class="subhead">02. The Response</p>

  <h3>The Trebuchet Trials: demonstrating the relationship between potential and kinetic energy</h3>
  <p>The Trebuchet Trials is a STEM education kit that encourages learning through play. Developed with the help of teachers, 4th grade students, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education">Microsoft Education</a>, it addresses the need to provide experiental STEM education to kids growing up in an increasingly digital world.</p>

  <p>Our response was based on the 4<sup>th</sup> grade NGSS Standard 4-PS3-4: Apply scientific ideas to test a device that converts energy from one form to another. In our case, the trebuchet teaches the concepts of transforming potential to kinetic energy.</p>

  <div>
    <h5>Live graphical mirroring</h5>
    <p>Using data streamed from an Arduino accelerometer, a digital trebuchet mirrors the movement of the physical trebuchet to create a delightful interaction.</p>

  <div>
    <h5>Targeted challenges</h5>
    <p>We found through classroom testing that students need specific goals so that the play-learning is structured. Asking them to hit certain criteria with their tests encourages critical thinking and pattern recognition.</p>

  <div>
    <h5>Automated data tracking</h5>
    <p>Every time a projectile is launched, the interface automatically calculates the kinetic energy and graphs it in the data tracker. Minimal manual input lets students focus on identifying trends, not rote recording.</p>

  <div>
    <h5>Low-cost setup</h5>
    <p>Not including the Arduino and computer, this 3-student group activity is made from classroom materials. The main components are a $5 accelerometer and printed cardstock templates. It costs ~$4 per student.</p>

  <p class="subhead">03. Design Process</p>

  <h5>Starting with the literature</h5>
  <p>At the outset, we knew we needed to develop a conceptual framework about what makes a successful educational experience for kids. We noticed <a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/constructionism-2014.pdf">trends in STEM education</a> have shifted towards creative experimentation and play as a form of learning. Some thought leaders like Mitchel Resnick also argue for the value of a constructionist approach, where students assemble the tool that is then used for experimentation. We also thoroughly reviewed Microsoft's Hacking STEM projects.</p>
</section>

<section class="animate-on-scroll">
  <h5>Straight into concepting</h5>
  <p>Our ideation process started by selecting an interesting NGSS standard and generating a physical experiment and digital interface that we thought could teach it, while considering what we had gathered from our literature review.</p>
</section>

<section class="animate-on-scroll">
  <h5>Narrowing to 3 directions</h5>
  <p>There were so many unknowns: were any of these ideas technically feasible? Would they spark joy and also be educational? Are they age-appropriate? We did our best to extrapolate these unknowns by gathering feedback from the studio for the most promising directions forward. We looked more closely at the ideas that excited us and enumerated the unknowns, risks, and education value of each.</p>
  <p>After a couple rounds of studio voting and discussions with advisors, we narrowed to the trebuchet, a hydroelectric turbine, and a DIY speaker, shown in sketches below.</p>

</div>


<section class="animate-on-scroll">
  <h5>Pushing ahead with prototypes</h5>
  <p>We needed to start getting our ideas in front of kids and teachers to help narrow into a single direction, so we made video and experiential prototypes for each concept. We showed the video prototypes to elementary school teachers, and brought the experiential prototypes to a group of kids to gather their feedback.</p>

</div>

<section class="animate-on-scroll">
  <h5>Triangulating stakeholder perspectives</h5>
  <p>Generating rapid prototypes made us start to grapple with designing for multiple stakeholders. We found that kids were highly engaged with the speaker and trebuchet concepts, that teachers thought the trebuchet was the most educational, but that our contact at Microsoft thought that the trebuchet might descend into classroom chaos. We needed to find a way to make the experiments manageable in the classroom setting.</p>

  <p>Consider this a case study MVP. I'll add more detailed designs and the process once I get the chance.</p>

  <h5>Choosing the trebuchet</h5>
  <p>Ultimately we moved forward with the trebuchet. We knew that it was engaging for kids, and that the educational aspect was valid, but that one of our larger design challenges would be securing stakeholder buy-in from Microsoft. We also were unsure of some of the technical aspects–which sensors could we use to collect the data needed to calculate energy? And how could we make the technical aspect simple enough for kids to set up?</p>

  <div>
    <h5>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</h5>
    <p>One of our first goals with the trebuchet was to develop a Wizard of Oz prototype that simulated the functioning activity. I expanded on the core functions of the interface–this early sketch imagines a hole-and-peg positioning system, a timer, and projectile distance measurements.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="two-column animate-on-scroll">
  <div>
    <h5>Digital iteration</h5>
    <p>The interface we used in WOZ testing was a clickable Figma prototype, where I acted as the wizard and input real-time "data" to simulate energy measurements. It used a stepwise input system that we discovered was unnecessary for the experiment.</p>

  <div>
    <h5>Responding to feedback</h5>
    <p>We found that the hole-and-peg system, where kids change the arm position as an experiment variable, was cumbersome and ineffective. Additionally, the relationship between the changes in variables and the resulting output data were too abstract. We responded by shifting to a variable weight system where kids control the amount of weights used and the type of projectiles used.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<section class="animate-on-scroll">
  <h5>Validation in the classroom</h5>
  <p>We had the opportunity to test with a group of eighteen 4th graders during their classtime at a local elementary school. This was our chance to evaluate if the activity would descend into chaos–a potential death knell for the trebuchet.</p>
