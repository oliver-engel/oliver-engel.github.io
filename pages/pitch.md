#### Pitch.ai is a public speaking trainer that lets a user record themselves practicing, and in turn receive a set of actionable tips, data visualizations, and training course recommendations.

It uses machine learning algorithms to compare recorded videos to a database of speeches, providing users with objective insights into their performance.

It's designed with working professionals in mind, with the goal of being offered as an employee benefit. Think of it like a Grammarly for public speaking.

Pitch.ai was created for a student course at the University of Washington.
