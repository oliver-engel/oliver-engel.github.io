<p class="subhead">01. Setting the stage</p>

### As part of a successful green card application, [Boundless Immigration](https://www.boundless.com/) needs to collect dozens of difficult-to-obtain documents from customers.

<div class="content-two-column">
  <p class="has-dropcap">The process can take some customers weeks or months to complete. Moreover, a Boundless team member needs to look at every single uploaded document, and often give feedback to the customer. Customers were frustrated that we couldn't give them that valuable feedback until they'd spent time finding every possible document we asked for.</p>

      <p>Whole lotta documents: after a new immigration ruling, customers suddenly had to upload twice as many documents, leading to a backlog of 20,000+ to review.</p>

<p class="subhead">02. My Role</p>

### I led the redesign of an internal review tool, a customer-facing upload tool, and changes to our operations to address a frustrating customer experience and reduce our backlog.
