    <h3>Endless</h3>
    <h6>A warped VR simulation of hellish quotidian.</h6>
    <p>Players complete a day in the life (wake up, go to work, sleep, repeat), and earn a point each time they finish a day. They have 30 seconds to figure out a simple puzzle to move to the next part of the day, but each time a new cycle begins, their view is more progressively warped. Players report feeling physically sick after a few rounds. How much torture are you willing to endure for the high score</p>

    <h3>Splitscreen</h3>
    <h6>Playing with the syntax of news headlines.</h6>
    <p>The program scrapes recent articles from different news sources, and combines them into one–spitting the result out into a terminal screen. It was created using Python, with some help from the <a href="https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Newspaper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics">ASCIImatics</a> APIs. Created during the 2016 presidential election.</p>
