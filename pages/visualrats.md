  <h3>Endless</h3>
  <p style="color:white">A warped VR simulation of hellish quotidian.</p>
  <p>Players complete a day in the life (wake up, go to work, sleep, repeat), and earn a point each time they finish a day. They have 30 seconds to figure out a simple puzzle to move to the next part of the day, but each time a new cycle begins, their view is more progressively warped. Players report feeling physically sick after a few rounds. How much torture are you willing to endure for the high score?</p>

  <p>Created with Unity 3D, and coded in C#.</p>

  <h3>On the Border</h3>
  <p style="color:white">A TV advertisement for a small business.</p>
  <p>A local Mexican chain called On The Border approached NBC7 to have a 15 second TV spot made. The only assets I had to work with were a logo, voiceover, and two photos: some enchiladas and a margarita.</p>

  <p>Created with After Effects.</p>

  <h3>Splitscreen</h3>
  <p style="color:white">Playing with the syntax of news headlines.</p>
  <p>The program scrapes recent articles from different news sources, and combines them into oneâ€“spitting the result out into a terminal screen. It was created using Python, with some help from the <a href="https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Newspaper</a> and <a href="https://github.com/peterbrittain/asciimatics">ASCIImatics</a> APIs. Created during the 2016 presidential election.</p>

  <h3>Ultrasound</h3>
  <p style="color:white">An abstract music video script with Processing and OpenCV.</p>
  <p>I wrote a piece of software that uses live video processing and audio analysis to create an abstract music video. It uses OpenCV for edge detection and runs on <a href="https://processing.org/">Processing</a>, taking video from a laptop camera. The video is an example of a performance I gave to my class in 2017.</p>
