<p class="subhead">about the project</p>

### I had the privilege of joining [Collective Healthâ€™s](https://collectivehealth.com/) Design Systems team, where I helped develop pieces of a design system for the iOS & Android consumer apps.

##### I learned a great deal about the level of detail that goes into a design system by working extensively with type, colors, icons & more. Please reach out for more info.
