#### Why tables?

Tables are some of the bread and butter of interface design. They also figure largely in my current role at [Samsara](https://samsara.com/), where I've learned a great deal about what goes into a high-quality table.

Too many design resources are optimized for visual aesthetic rather than real-world flexibility; this free UI kit aims to address some of the painpoints of actually designing tables.

The kit uses best practice UI construction (autolayout, responsive elements, etc.) and features a customizable design system to make designing and changing tables simple and fluid.
