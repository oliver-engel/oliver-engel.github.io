        <p>Our response was based on the 4<sup>th</sup> grade NGSS Standard 4-PS3-4: Apply scientific ideas to test a device that converts energy from one form to another. In our case, the trebuchet teaches the concepts of transforming potential to kinetic energy.</p>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation" id="ideation">
        <h3>Starting with the literature</h3>
        <p>At the outset, we knew we needed to develop a conceptual framework about what makes a successful educational experience for kids. We noticed <a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/constructionism-2014.pdf" target="_blank">trends
            in STEM education</a> have shifted towards creative experimentation and play as a form of learning. Some thought leaders like Mitchel Resnick also argue for the value of a constructionist approach, where students assemble the tool that is
          then used for experimentation. We also thoroughly reviewed Microsoft's Hacking STEM projects.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation image-next">
        <h3>Straight into concepting</h3>
        <p>Our ideation process started by selecting an interesting NGSS standard and generating a physical experiment and digital interface that we thought could teach it, while considering what we had gathered from our literature review.</p>
      </div>

        <h5>Narrowing to 3</h5>
        <p>There were so many unknowns: were any of these ideas technically feasible? Would they spark joy and also be educational? Are they age-appropriate? We did our best to extrapolate these unknowns by gathering feedback from the studio
          for the most promising directions forward. We looked more closely at the ideas that excited us and enumerated the unknowns, risks, and education value of each.</p>
        <p>After a couple rounds of studio voting and discussions with advisors, we narrowed to the trebuchet, a hydroelectric turbine, and a DIY speaker, shown in sketches below.</p>

        <h2>Pushing ahead with prototypes</h2>
        <p>We needed to start getting our ideas in front of kids and teachers to help narrow into a single direction, so we made video and experiential prototypes for each concept. We showed the video prototypes to elementary school teachers, and
          brought the experiential prototypes to a group of kids to gather their feedback.</p>

        <h5>Triangulating stakeholder perspectives</h5>
        <p>Generating rapid prototypes made us start to grapple with designing for multiple stakeholders. We found that kids were highly engaged with the speaker and trebuchet concepts, that teachers thought the trebuchet was the most educational,
          but that our contact at Microsoft thought that the trebuchet might descend into classroom chaos. We needed to find a way to make the experiments manageable in the classroom setting.</p>

        <h5>Choosing the trebuchet</h5>
        <p>Ultimately we moved forward with the trebuchet. We knew that it was engaging for kids, and that the educational aspect was valid, but that one of our larger design challenges would be securing stakeholder buy-in from Microsoft. We also were unsure
          of some of the technical aspects‚Äìwhich sensors could we use to collect the data needed to calculate energy? And how could we make the technical aspect simple enough for kids to set up?</p>

        <h5>Lots of positives, and things to change</h5>
        <p>Surprisingly, the chaos we expected was averted! After a short demo, we had kids form groups to assemble and test the trebuchets. The building process was significantly quicker than we imagined, the educational value was apparent, and we received positive
          feedback from both students and the teacher.</p>

        <p>It wasn't all peaches and cream; we found that using a pouch-and-sling launch mechanism was frustrating, since it had a high rate of failure. It also became a game of "who can launch the biggest projectile the farthest?" Kids weren't
          exploring the full range of variables.</p>

          <h5 class="top-space-h5">Incorporating challenges</h5>
        <p>The teacher suggested that we incorporate specific goals for students to achieve in order to make the experiment more guided. We used this feedback to develop a set of challenges in the digital interface.</p>

        <h5>Benchmarking to current classroom materials</h5>
        <p>We were also excited to find that the students had just finished an energy unit, and understood the mechanics of the activity. We were able to look through the classes' paper worksheets to help benchmark the level of complexity to in-use
          classroom materials. We looked specifically at the language used in assignments and the overall activity complexity.</p>

        <h5 class="top-space-h5">Reflecting on the session</h5>
        <p>I felt that the success of the classroom test session was largely due to the fact that our homemade trebuchet just <i>wasn‚Äôt that good</i>. It launched fairly short distances even with a bunch of weights added‚Äìbut that happened to be the perfect
          way to control chaos in the classroom, while still allowing for fun and play.</p>

        <h5>Responding to a second co-design session</h5>
        <p>A second co-design session with kids revealed a lack of interactive joy in the interface. One kid suggested adding a flying cow that moved when the trebuchet was fired. Although I didn't include a cow, I took that as inspiration to create
          the above interactive trebuchet graphic, which I mapped to the movement of the actual trebuchet. Data streamed from an accelerometer affords a 1:1 mapping, although above you can control it with just your cursor.</p>

        <p >Working with Javascript ‚Äì <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.JS</a> in particular ‚Äì made me realize that graphing energy values automatically after each trial was possible. This could address the issue we saw in
          behavioral prototypes where keeping track of values became cumbersome‚Äìnow kids could record data simply through playing.</p>
        <p>This meant that the interface could be simplified, since the only manual input now needed was the number of weights being used.</p>
        <p>Similarly, using CSS variables meant that it was easy to create different color palettes for the experiment and challenges sections, something which I had presumed to need extensive Javascript.</p>

          <p>Yeehaw! During a showcase at Microsoft in Redmond, WA, we won an award for the "best technical implementation"‚Äìthe integration of physical and digital forms. Thanks to my great teammates Sakshat Goyal and Javan Wang, and also to advisors
            Michael Smith and Jon Froehlich.</p>

        <h5>Strength in constraints</h5>

        <p>Designing with such a tight set of constraints gave our team the ability to rapidly ideate, downselect, and test our concepts and assumptions. We were always able to fall back on a set of key questions‚Äìis this achieving our desired
          NGSS standard? Will this cost less than $10 per student? Would this work in a classroom?</p>

        <h5 class="top-space-h5">Designing for multiple stakeholders</h5>

        <p>Possibly the most difficult aspect was meeting the needs of multiple stakeholders‚Äìteachers, students, and Microsoft Education would sometimes give clashing feedback. Our use of prototypes‚Äìfrom behavioral, to video, to functional,
          varied according to the particular stakeholder, and allowed us to triangulate design insights through our interactions with each party.</p>

        <h5 class="top-space-h5">Prototyping in code</h5>

        <p>Prototyping in code was an enlightening design exercise. Although we spent most of the time on paper and whitebords, it wasn't until we could interact with a functioning system that the experience became visceral. There's a tradeoff that
          happens on paper: it's rapid to advance with sketches, but the gap between a static drawing and a breathing piece of code is vast. Working with code as a material is an opportunity to let new inspiration emerge from the making process.</p>

        <h5 class="top-space-h5">Measuring success</h5>

        <p>It's always difficult to measure the success of a student project‚Äìwe didn't ship the full activity out to teachers, nor do we have the juicy statistics that most companies measure success by. However, I think that the success
          of our project could be evaluated by the directness of our responses to prototype testing outcomes. We had a fairly rigorous process of distilling the key weaknesses of each prototype after each session and developing a plan to address or
          further investigate each one. We constantly iterated on the physical form and the digital interface, to the point that the studio was littered with trebuchets and whiteboard scribblings.</p>
