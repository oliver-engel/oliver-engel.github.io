          it addresses the need to provide experiental STEM education to kids growing up in an increasingly digital world.</p>
        <p>I contributed materially to the design of a functioning digital data workbook & physical computing features, and worked with kids and teachers to iteratively refine the experiment. We recieved an award for <strong>Best Technical Implementation</strong> during an expo at Microsoft in Redmond, WA.</p>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation" id="ideation">
        <h3>Starting with the literature</h3>
        <p>At the outset, we knew we needed to develop a conceptual framework about what makes a successful educational experience for kids. We noticed <a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/constructionism-2014.pdf" target="_blank">trends
            in STEM education</a> have shifted towards creative experimentation and play as a form of learning. Some thought leaders like Mitchel Resnick also argue for the value of a constructionist approach, where students assemble the tool that is
          then used for experimentation. We also thoroughly reviewed Microsoft's Hacking STEM projects.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation image-next">
        <h3>Straight into concepting</h3>
        <p>Our ideation process started by selecting an interesting NGSS standard and generating a physical experiment and digital interface that we thought could teach it, while considering what we had gathered from our literature review.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation">
        <p>However, there were so many unknowns: were any of these ideas technically feasible? Would they spark joy and also be educational? Are they age-appropriate? We did our best to extrapolate these unknowns by gathering feedback from the studio
          for the most promising directions forward.</p>
        <p>After a couple rounds of studio voting and discussions with advisors, we narrowed to the trebuchet, a hydroelectric turbine, and a DIY speaker, shown in sketches below.</p>

          brought the experiential prototypes to a group of kids to gather their feedback.</p>

        <p>Surprisingly‚Ä¶ it didn‚Äôt! After a short demo, we had kids form groups to assemble and test the trebuchets. The building process was significantly quicker than we imagined, the educational value was apparent, and we received positive
          feedback from both students and the teacher.</p>

        <p>It wasn't all peaches and cream; we found that using a pouch-and-sling launch mechanism was frustrating, since it had a high rate of failure. It also became a game of "who can launch the biggest projectile the farthest?" Kids weren't
          exploring the full range of variables.</p>

        <p>The teacher suggested that we incorporate specific goals for students to achieve in order to make the experiment more guided. We used this feedback to develop a set of challenges in the digital interface.</p>

        <p>We were also excited to find that the students had just finished an energy unit, and understood the mechanics of the activity. We were able to look through the classes' paper worksheets to help benchmark the level of complexity to in-use
          classroom materials.</p>

        <p>I felt that the success of the classroom test session was largely due to the fact that our homemade trebuchet just wasn‚Äôt that good. It launched fairly short distances even with a bunch of weights added‚Äìbut that happened to be the perfect
          way to control
          chaos in the classroom, while still allowing for fun and play.</p>

        <p>A second co-design session with kids revealed a lack of interactive joy in the interface. One kid suggested adding a flying cow that moved when the trebuchet was fired. Although I didn't include a cow, I took that as inspiration to create
          the above interactive trebuchet graphic, which I mapped to the movement of the actual trebuchet. Data streamed from an accelerometer affords a 1:1 mapping, although above you can control it with just your cursor.</p>

        <p style="padding-top:50px">Working with Javascript ‚Äì <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.JS</a> in particular ‚Äì made me realize that graphing energy values automatically after each trial was possible. This could address the issue we saw in
          behavioral prototypes where keeping track of values became cumbersome‚Äìnow kids could record data simply through playing.</p>
        <p>This meant that the interface could be simplified, since the only manual input now needed was the number of weights being used.</p>
        <p>Similarly, using CSS variables meant that it was easy to create different color palettes for the experiment and challenges sections, something which I had presumed to need extensive Javascript.</p>

        <h2 id="reflection">Reflecting on the experience</h2>
        <p>Designing with such a tight set of constraints gave our team the ability to rapidly ideate, downselect, and test our concepts and assumptions. We were always able to fall back on a set of key questions‚Äìis this achieving our desired
          NGSS standard? Will this cost less than $10 per student? Would this work in a classroom?</p>
        <p>Possibly the most difficult aspect was meeting the needs of multiple stakeholders‚Äìteachers, students, and Microsoft Education would sometimes give clashing feedback. Our use of prototypes‚Äìfrom behavioral, to video, to functional,
          varied according to the particular stakeholder, and allowed us to triangulate design insights through our interactions with each party.</p>
        <p>Prototyping in code was an enlightening design exercise. Although we spent most of the time on paper and whitebords, it wasn't until we could interact with a functioning system that the experience became visceral. There's a tradeoff that
          happens on paper: it's rapid to advance with sketches, but the gap between a static drawing and a breathing piece of code is vast. Working with code as a material is an opportunity to let new inspiration emerge from the making process.</p>

        <p>It's always difficult to measure the success of a student project‚Äìwe didn't ship the full activity out to teachers, nor do we have the juicy ROI/LTV/etc. statistics that most companies measure success by. However, I think that the success
          of our project could be evaluated by the directness of our responses to prototype testing outcomes. We had a fairly rigorous process of distilling the key weaknesses of each prototype after each session and developing a plan to address or
          further investigate each one. We constantly iterated on the physical form and the digital interface, to the point that the studio was littered with trebuchets and whiteboard scribblings.</p>

          <p>Yeehaw! During a showcase at Microsoft in Redmond, WA, we won an award for the "best technical implementation"‚Äìthe integration of physical and digital forms. Thanks to my great teammates Sakshat Goyal and Javan Wang, and also to advisors
