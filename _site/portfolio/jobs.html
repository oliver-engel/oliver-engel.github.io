a team on) the future of a core product offering.</p></div><div class="video-embed-wrapper"><div class="video-embed fadeIn"> <iframe

jobs experience was slowly falling behind the competition.</h3><h3>The job search experience lacked much of the polish and completeness expected of a consumer-grade product; basic features like type-ahead & saved searches were missing, filtering was a hodge-podge from years of additions, and the relevance of search results was ‘mid’ at best.</h3><h3>There was no coherent, long-term roadmap of improvements to prioritize work against.</h3><hr><p class="subhead">The work</p><h3>As design lead, I spent 2 months exploring new futures for Handshake's job search experience, ultimately using the work to align our product team and leadership on multiple quarters worth of new projects.</h3><h3>Below are a few of the feature proposals that resulted from the work.</h3><hr></div><div class="expanded-content"><div class="video-embed fadeIn"> <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/906569703?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&autoplay=1&loop=1&background=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" title="applyflow"></iframe></div></div><div class="main-content"><h3>Job alerts: get the jump on new job postings</h3><p>Competitive analysis and interviews with students quickly revealed that our lack of a saved search / job alert experience made it more difficult to find fresh jobs.</p><p>Job alerts give students a one-tap solution to staying on top of new jobs that meet their specific search criteria; they can combine keyword searches and filters, and be configured to send daily or weekly via email and push notification.</p><p>The feature launched in December 2023, and in the first month produced a 26% increase in the number of jobs saved by students, and a 5% increase in completed job applications.</p><hr></div><div class="expanded-content"><div class="video-embed fadeIn"> <iframe

title="applyflow"></iframe></div></div><div class="main-content"><h3>Core search and type-ahead</h3><p>Surprisingly, our job search experience lacked any semblance of type-ahead features, likely contributing to the very low conversion rate to job saves and applies from keyword searches. A lack of help from Handshake left students with no idea how rich our inventory of jobs was, since they had to guess as to what they might be able to search for.</p><p>One of my proposals was to introduce type-ahead, which has now been launched – and increased job saves after keyword searches by 122%.</p><hr></div><div class="expanded-content"><div class="video-embed fadeIn"> <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/906573593?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&autoplay=1&loop=1&background=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" title="applyflow"></iframe></div></div><div class="main-content"><h3>Upgraded filtering experience</h3><p>It was clear from research that our filters weren't cutting it: students were overwhelmed by the choices and couldn't find basic filters like pay (because they didn't exist!)</p><p>Updating our filtering experience was table stakes for an improved job search. I referenced usage data to cut down the ones we didn't need, and interview & survey insights to propose new additions.</p><p>The team has used the concepts to iteratively improve filtering; pay, company size, and collections filters have been added, and a number of others removed. Pay has been the most popular filter, leading to a 56% in applied filters and a 9% increase in jobs saved by students.</p><hr></div><div class="expanded-content"> <img src="/assets/img/projects/jobs/discover.jpg"><figcaption>From L to R: career path explorer, discovery landing page, collections.</figcaption></div><div class="main-content"><h3>Jobs and career discovery: a suite of exploration-focused features</h3><p>Key insights from user research and usage data told us that students just weren't interacting with keyword searches or filters – they preferred to scroll and see what the algorithm found for them because the student population is particularly unsure of what jobs they should be looking for.</p><p>With this in mind, I proposed a suite of discovery-related features to give students a more curated, personalized 'feed-like' experience within job search.</p><p>Of the features, school-picked collections has launched, leading to a 18% increase in job saves and 155% increase in job impressions.</p></div><div class="expanded-content"><div class="video-embed fadeIn"> <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/906525202?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&autoplay=1&loop=1&background=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" title="applyflow"></iframe></div></div><div class="main-content"><h3>Match batch: a weekly round-up of new recommended jobs, delivered Tinder-style</h3><p>This was one of the concepts I created to make Handshake's jobs platform more sticky, by re-engaging students once a week with fresh batches of recommendations.</p><p>While this experience was deprioritized in favor of other projects, it tested well with students and is one of my personal faves.</p><hr><h3>Here's what the live experience looked like when I started this work. You'll notice that it uses quite a different visual language – at the time of the project, Handshake was just beginning to transition to an updated design system.</h3><h3>I was one of the early adopters of the new system and took the opportunity to explore how it applied to real product scenarios.</h3></div><div class="expanded-content"><div class="video-embed fadeIn"> <iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/906600601?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479&autoplay=1&loop=1&background=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" title="applyflow"></iframe></div><figcaption>The existing job search experience.</figcaption><hr></div><div class="main-content"><h2>Process artifacts<h2> <br><h3>I produced a metric ton of exploratory design work, collaborated with a user researcher to run discovery research and concept validation, and worked closely with my PM to align on the overall strategy.</h3><h3>I'm happy to discuss the process in more detail – here are some of the highlights.</h3><hr><h3>Research & data review, competitive auditing</h3><p>I start every project with a thorough review of available research & data and a survey of the competitive landscape.</p><img src="/assets/img/projects/jobs/insights.jpg"><figcaption>I reviewed research from last ~3 years to pull out everything relevant to job search.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/jobs/data.jpg"><figcaption>Working with the data team to pull relevant queries helped orient me to the state of job search.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/jobs/compete.jpg"><figcaption>A snapshot from the competitive audit.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/jobs/strategy.jpg"><figcaption>I started a source-of-truth strategy doc to track the work and gather feedback.</figcaption><hr><h2>Leading a cross-functional brainstorm<h2> <br><h3>The project lined up nicely with a pre-planned jobs team onsite in San Francisco, about 50 members from eng, design, data, and product.</h3><h3>Although I couldn't attend in person, I remotely led a collaborative brainstorm that served as a 'heads up' on the project and helped generate a ton of ideas and challenges to consider.</h3><h3>The activities were centered around responding to a series of how might we statements that were generated in the research and auditing phase.</h3><img src="/assets/img/projects/jobs/brainstorm.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/projects/jobs/brainstorm-detail.jpg"><figcaption>Snapshots from a Figjam board where I ran a series of ideation and storytelling activities.</figcaption><hr><h2>Synthesizing & exploring</h2><br><h3>After the workshop, I synthesized out key themes and top ideas and started translating them into rough visualizations.</h3><h3>A series of design crits and jobs team shareouts helped refine ideas and decide which ones to pursue further.</h3><img src="/assets/img/projects/jobs/ideate.jpg"><figcaption>Lots of feedback, and even more ideas.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/jobs/ideate2.jpg"><figcaption>Directly translating workshop outcomes into potential directions.</figcaption><hr><h2>Concept testing</h2><br><h3>I worked with a user researcher to run a series of quick concept test + iteration cycles, tweaking the concepts each time they were shown.</h3><h3>Testing helped refine some ideas, archive others, and generate new ideas entirely.
