href="https://joinhandshake.com/">Handshake</a>.</h3><h3>Design cycles were spent re-hashing the same decisions; developers kept implementing their own components. Cards were expensive to build and maintain.</h3><h3>What's more – we had an upcoming product launch for a new social media feed product that would be made almost completely from content cards.<h3>We needed a system to make the design and development of cards easy and consistent that worked for web and native mobile platforms.</h3></div><div class="expanded-content"> <img src="/assets/img/projects/cards/cards-before.jpg"><figcaption>Some of the many types of cards in Handshake.</figcaption><hr></div><div class="main-content"><p class="subhead">My role<p><h3>I worked as the design lead to unify our approach to cards into a systematic yet flexible framework, coordinating with 3 different teams of product designers, PMs, and engineers to align on a system proposal and translate it into the live product.</h3><hr><p class="subhead">The work<p><h3>As the lead on Handshake's design systems team, I saw firsthand the wide range of cards being discussed in design reviews and critiques, and proposed a project to come up with a unified system.</h3><p>I took charge on:</p><ul><li>Auditing our existing cards and competitive examples</li><li>Exploring potential card systems</li><li>Visual and interaction design of the components</li><li>Moving the work through multiple leadership reviews</li></ul><p>I built off early card designs that various product designers had explored for their respective product areas, and worked with them to present the work to leadership. I led a series of roadshow presentations with a number of feature teams to get more buy-in for the system.</p><img src="/assets/img/projects/cards/cards-ios.jpg"><figcaption>Cards in the home feed and job search.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/cards/cards-ios2.jpg"><figcaption>Cards in the reminders sheet and saved tab.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/cards/feed-cards.jpg"><figcaption>Examples of card use cases from across the Handshake product.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/cards/figma-components.png"><figcaption>I created reusable Figma components for web, mobile, and email.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/cards/annotation.jpg"><figcaption>I meticulously annotated decisions and worked with engineering to codify them into the component.</figcaption><hr><h3>The outcome: simplified decision making, a successful Feed launch, cheaper card implementations, and greater product polish & consistency.</h3><p>The card system simplifies decision-making when introducing new card variants, and creates reusable components that reduces the time spent during eng implementation. The new cards are in use today across web, iOS, and Android.</p><p>These cards were included in the launch of Handshake's Feed product, which bumped our weekly active users by >300% for participating universities, and is scheduled for a wider launch in February 2024.</p><p>Now, designers are able to take ready-made components and customize them in ways that match the implementation in code, which significantly reduces the time it takes to implement experiences that require a card component.</p><p>The card system is already being extended and flexed into new use cases across our Employer and School products. It speeds up the delivery time significantly for a card by providing a plug-and-play framework for designers and developers.</p><hr><h3>Process artifacts</h3><p>I took a rigorous approach to auditing our existing cards, exploring potential directions, and aligning on a proposal with feature teams and design & engineering leadership. <u>I’m happy to discuss my process in more detail in a conversation–these are just some snippets of artifacts from the design process.</u></p><img src="/assets/img/projects/cards/variants.jpg"><figcaption>Defining card hierarchies helped flex the component to different use cases.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/cards/process.jpg"><figcaption>Using matrices for auditing and exploration helped me test how the system would play out in a variety of real scenarios.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/cards/documentation.jpg"><figcaption>Example of documentation I created to ensure variants followed a strict component-driven system; also useful to communicate the options clearly with engineering teams.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/cards/emailcards.jpg"><figcaption>Example of documentation created specifically for cards that live in emails.</figcaption><img src="/assets/img/projects/cards/decisions.jpg"><figcaption>I kept track of key decisions we made throughout the multiple product and design review cycles.</figcaption><hr><h3>Want to learn more?</h3><p>I'd be delighted to walk through the designs and process in more detail in a portfolio review or conversation.</p><hr> <a href="/portfolio"><h3>Back to projects</h3></a></div></div><script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script></body></html>
