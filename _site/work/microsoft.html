Design Process</p><p class="subhead">03. Design Process</p><h5>Starting with the literature</h5><p>At the outset, we knew we needed to develop a conceptual framework about what makes a successful educational experience for kids. We noticed <a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/constructionism-2014.pdf">trends in STEM education</a> have shifted towards creative experimentation and play as a form of learning. Some thought leaders like Mitchel Resnick also argue for the value of a constructionist approach, where students assemble the tool that is then used for experimentation. We also thoroughly reviewed Microsoft's Hacking STEM projects.</p></section><section class="animate-on-scroll"><h5>Straight into concepting</h5><p>Our ideation process started by selecting an interesting NGSS standard and generating a physical experiment and digital interface that we thought could teach it, while considering what we had gathered from our literature review.</p></section><img class="animate-on-scroll" src="/assets/img/uploads/microsoft/idea-grid.jpg"><section class="animate-on-scroll"><h5>Narrowing to 3 directions</h5><p>There were so many unknowns: were any of these ideas technically feasible? Would they spark joy and also be educational? Are they age-appropriate? We did our best to extrapolate these unknowns by gathering feedback from the studio for the most promising directions forward. We looked more closely at the ideas that excited us and enumerated the unknowns, risks, and education value of each.</p><p>After a couple rounds of studio voting and discussions with advisors, we narrowed to the trebuchet, a hydroelectric turbine, and a DIY speaker, shown in sketches below.</p></section><div class="three-column-grid animate-on-scroll"> <img src="/assets/img/uploads/microsoft/ideation-trebuchet.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/uploads/microsoft/ideation-speaker.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/uploads/microsoft/ideation-turbine.jpg"></div><section class="animate-on-scroll"><h5>Pushing ahead with prototypes</h5><p>We needed to start getting our ideas in front of kids and teachers to help narrow into a single direction, so we made video and experiential prototypes for each concept. We showed the video prototypes to elementary school teachers, and brought the experiential prototypes to a group of kids to gather their feedback.</p></section><img class="animate-on-scroll remove-top-padding" src="/assets/img/uploads/microsoft/experiential-prototype.jpg"><div class="two-column-grid animate-on-scroll"> <iframe class="autoplay-video" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/331924644?autoplay=1&loop=1&muted=1&autopause=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" ></iframe> <iframe class="autoplay-video" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/331924620?autoplay=1&loop=1&muted=1&autopause=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" ></iframe></div><section class="animate-on-scroll"><h5>Triangulating stakeholder perspectives</h5><p>Generating rapid prototypes made us start to grapple with designing for multiple stakeholders. We found that kids were highly engaged with the speaker and trebuchet concepts, that teachers thought the trebuchet was the most educational, but that our contact at Microsoft thought that the trebuchet might descend into classroom chaos. We needed to find a way to make the experiments manageable in the classroom setting.</p></section><div class="project-header animate-on-scroll themered" ><div class="project-header-content "> <img class="icon-small" src="/assets/img/icons/quote.svg"><h4>In fourth grade we do an energy unit and this could perfectly tie into the unit, and actually work better than some of our existing experiments...

We knew that it was engaging for kids, and that the educational aspect was valid, but that one of our larger design challenges would be securing stakeholder buy-in from Microsoft. We also were unsure of some of the technical aspectsâ€“which sensors could we use to collect the data needed to calculate energy? And how could we make the technical aspect simple enough for kids to set up?</p></section><div class="two-column animate-on-scroll"> <iframe class="autoplay-video" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/331924644?autoplay=1&loop=1&muted=1&autopause=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" ></iframe><div><h5>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</h5><p>One of our first goals with the trebuchet was to develop a Wizard of Oz prototype that simulated the functioning activity. I expanded on the core functions of the interfaceâ€“this early sketch imagines a hole-and-peg positioning system, a timer, and projectile distance measurements.</p></div></div><div class="two-column animate-on-scroll"><div><h5>Digital iteration</h5><p>The interface we used in WOZ testing was a clickable Figma prototype, where I acted as the wizard and input real-time "data" to simulate energy measurements. It used a stepwise input system that we discovered was unnecessary for the experiment.</p></div><iframe class="autoplay-video" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/331924644?autoplay=1&loop=1&muted=1&autopause=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" ></iframe></div><div class="two-column animate-on-scroll"> <iframe class="autoplay-video" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/331924644?autoplay=1&loop=1&muted=1&autopause=0" width="640" height="360" frameborder="0" ></iframe><div><h5>Responding to feedback</h5><p>We found that the hole-and-peg system, where kids change the arm position as an experiment variable, was cumbersome and ineffective. Additionally, the relationship between the changes in variables and the resulting output data were too abstract. We responded by shifting to a variable weight system where kids control the amount of weights used and the type of projectiles used.</p></div></div><section class="animate-on-scroll"><h5>Validation in the classroom</h5><p>We had the opportunity to test with a group of eighteen 4th graders during their classtime at a local elementary school. This was our chance to evaluate if the activity would descend into chaosâ€“a potential death knell for the trebuchet.</p></section><div class="project-two-column animate-on-scroll"> <img src="/assets/img/uploads/microsoft/ideation-trebuchet.jpg"> <img src="/assets/img/uploads/microsoft/ideation-speaker.jpg"></div>--></div></div></div><!-- --><footer> <a class="resume" href="/assets/files/EngelOliver_Resume.pdf">Resume</a> <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Capitol+Hill,+Seattle,+WA/@47.6278632,-122.3333217,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x5490152857c86161:0xef487dc6bbc25185!8m2!3d47.625305!4d-122.3221835" class="subhead footnote"><i class="fas fa-map-marker-alt"></i> 47.6253Â° N, 122.3222Â° W</p><a class="linkedin" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/oengel/">LinkedIn</a></footer><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.5.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-9/aliU8dGd2tb6OSsuzixeV4y/faTqgFtohetphbbj0=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/animejs/2.0.2/anime.min.js"></script> <script src="https://unpkg.com/masonry-layout@4/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/scripts.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/masonry.min.js"></script><link href="https://unpkg.com/aos@2.3.1/dist/aos.css" rel="stylesheet"> <script src="https://unpkg.com/aos@2.3.1/dist/aos.js"></script> <script> AOS.init(); </script></body></html>
