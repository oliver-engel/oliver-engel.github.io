**Design has an image problem**

In 2015, InVision released a documentary called _Design Disruptors_ that captured the meteoric rise of design in the public eye. More than ever before, it argues, design is solving real problems and proposing better futures, and people are taking notice.

Today, design is often heralded as a solution to our myriad societal problems. Design is considered an act of disruption and change-making that empowers people to live better lives. I think that design has an ego that outsizes the role that it really plays and betrays the core values it loudly and profusely claims to embody.

One of the most palpable manifestations of this propaganda is the term “design thinking”. The term has permeated the mainstream consciousness, and through its popularity has been warped by over-simplification. Suddenly it is not only taught in design schools, but is taken up by hordes of “innovators” as a framework for future-building. Pentagram’s Natasha Jen says that “design thinking is nothing new. It’s a rudimentary problem-solving framework masquerading as a scientific method” ([src](https://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/natasha-jen-pentagram-graphicdesign-230218)).

Surely business and engineering are other drivers of “future-building”, alongside design, but it’s design thinking that is currently _en vogue_. I’d argue that we’re somewhere around the peak of inflated expectations

There’s a separation to be made here: professional designers are not necessarily the people who are being consumed by the propaganda that design thinking markets itself with. The real problem with design thinking is that, in a period of rapid influx of new designers and design education, it is watering down the rigor of the field. A quick browse of General Assembly’s [GA] User Experience Design courses portray a field decayed by marketing language and buzzwords. One offering is a two-hour “Intro to UX” webinar, of which one of the promised takeaways is the ability “to create a clickable prototype using InVision”.  Think about it: someone’s very first introduction to the field, and they’ve already been thrown into making screen prototypes–with little to no understanding of why it is being done. And as one graduate remarks in an anecdote, she was able to “introduce design thinking to [her] organization” after a single GA course. The delusion is compounded when you explore the plethora of two-day bootcamps and hackathons that promise to give attendees the tools they need to start designing. I would not trust a carpenter who learned the trade in a two-day carpeting bootcamp.

The propaganda rife in design education undercuts the intense richness of the field. When we say that everyone can design, we shout through a loudspeaker that our field in itself has no value; anyone can do it. A more appropriate response would be that everyone _can learn_ to design–it’s just hard.

So the propaganda of design’s value has crafted the framing and content of today’s design education. General Assembly and similar programs are pumping out designers primed to “innovate” with their new set of tools.

**The risks of misperception**
Ground zero for the pitfalls of design education is the student design case study, often found on Medium. These cookie-cutter design process documents often claim to take on huge, complex problems and most often result in some sort of phone app with detailed flows of log-ins and profiles and a few key features. [insert image from design case study]

What’s wrong here? A student in a design bootcamp or 2-month program is taught that design is a set of steps, a prescribed _method_ that necessarily involves some interviewing, persona generation, wireframing, etc. It’s a highly logical format that is repeated again and again in student work.

When design is reduced to a step-by-step recipe, it loses the reflective quality that is so core to its function. If we take Schön’s perspective that design is a conversation with the materials of a situation, then we see that the teaching of methodology alone leaves students ill-equipped to design in the real world. The primary material that designers engage with is uncertainty: things that are temporarily unknown and things that are simply unknowable.

It’s worthwhile to examine the language which new students of design use to describe their own work, which often lives only in mockups and does not enter the real world. It is common for a design response to be described as “revolutionary” or “empowering”, like this case study of a two-week design project that aimed to “improve the UX of the library” in order to save it from extinction[[src](https://uxplanet.org/libraries-2-0-2b16465c23e8)]. There’s three medium articles of process here–and then the final design solution is an app for people to reserve chairs in the library. The designer applauds his response as an “easy to apply, affordable, and useful” piece of design which “would only be a boost to culture and progress”.

There is little to no reflection about the fact that the design response hand-waves away just about every reality of the situation in an effort to make a final product. Yet this is what design education often values: tight sets of wireframes and flows that do not recognize the reality that most problems are intractable and wicked.



**On visual design**
The vocabulary of design propaganda is also visual. A cursory glance at Dribbble reveals a design zeitgeist saturated with hollow marketing copy and glossy illustrations that depict utopian visions of what a product can offer. [Pull in a dribble example] There’s a reason people talk about the “Dribbbilisation of design” [[src](https://www.intercom.com/blog/the-dribbblisation-of-design/)] – it’s a symptom of the _oversimplification_ of design. XXXXX from Intercom sums it up well:

> “If product design is about solving problems for people within the constraints of a specific business, then it simply feels that many people calling themselves product/UX designers are actually practicing digital art. They are Artists. They are Stylists. Executing beautiful looking things, certainly an important skill, but not practising product design.” [[src](https://www.intercom.com/blog/the-dribbblisation-of-design/)]  





**Impacts of over-simplification**
Designers wield a scary amount of power.


The increasing complexity of artificial things requires a more nuanced understanding and ability to design than ever before. John Christopher Jones says that ““the most obvious sign that we need better methods of designing and planning is the existence, in industrial countries, of massive unsolved problems created by the use of man-made things, for example traffic congestion, road accidents, urban decay, etc.”


**The gatekeeping of design**
I’d like to


There’s a real tension here between gatekeeping design and pushing it towards being a radically open and democratic process. Natasha Iskander proposed last year that




“Design Thinking gives students an unrealistic idea of design and the work that goes into creating positive change.” [[src](https://medium.com/@sts_news/design-thinking-is-kind-of-like-syphilis-its-contagious-and-rots-your-brains-842ed078af29)]. Can reference Natasha Jen’s design thinking is bullshit talk







But it won’t be like this forever. We already see the seams of tech starting to burst; Google & Amazon & Facebook are starting to be unmasked as the profiteering, blood-thirsty abusers of the system that many of the players in tech embody.



::Design vs. Capitalism::
How do you separate these? I sympathize with this view: that capital-d Design in often at odds with the economic machinery it exists in. Yet at the same time, design which is not disseminated in a market reaches nobody, so it could be the greatest design in the world but it would never make it into somebody’s home.

In just a couple of decades, the influx of wealth into tech (and its concentration in a handful of metropolitan areas), has reflected, if not outright exacerbated, extreme disparities in income equality.

This is not to say that design is at fault. I think that the opposite is more true: designers are often better equipped to “fight the good fight” in creating services that are friendlier to people. Yet there is a patina that what designers do is somewhat unmoored from the capitalist frameworks they design within. Central to the design practice is an ability to incorporate business interests into things that are designed. When one of my graduate school professors gives a demonstration of a whiteboarding design challenge (commonly used in tech as a barometer of interviewees’ design skills), his first impulse is to ask “what are the revenue drivers of this product”?

The tension between capital-d Design and business are not new. We can see a classic example in Germany’s Ulm School of Design…
