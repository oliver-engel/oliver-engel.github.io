### Weval – Someday
<code><b>2019 • Páraic Mc Gloughlin</b></code>

I don't know how this video possibly came into creation. What I do know is that it is shockingly well-done and surprises me every time I watch it. You'll be transfixed.

### James Blake – Can't Believe The Way We Flow
<code><b>2019 • Frank Lebon</b></code>

Equal parts nostalgic and modern, a brilliant music video about love and relationships. It gets real around the :40 mark.

### Aphex Twin - T69 Collapse
<code><b>2018 • Nicky Smith</b></code>

The top comment is "when you download an acid trip from your dealer and the .rar is corrupt". No further commentary.

### S+C+A+R+R – The Rest Of My Days
<code><b>2020 • Jack Antoine Charlot</b></code>

A disturbingly realistic mocap-based music video that sits neatly in the in the trough of the uncanny valley. The dance moves are pretty sweet.

### Radiohead – Weird Fishes
<code><b>2008 • Tobias Stretch</b></code>

I always come back to this one. There's something unsettling and beautiful about life-sized stop-motion. My only wish is that the video was higher quality.

### King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard – People-Vultures
<code><b>2016 • Danny Cohen / Jason Galea</b></code>

An enormous papier-mâché vulture roams the Australian wilderness and eliminates a series of enemies.
