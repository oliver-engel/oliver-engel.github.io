Over the last six months at Samsara, I've come to appreciate the value of data-driven design as an effective method of making decisions, telling stories, and ultimately shaping product and design decisions. I've still got plenty to learn here, but I wanted to share some tactical ways that data has influenced my design process.

#### Assessing magnitude

Most design projects I work on have some amount of research involved, whether it's talking to customers, pulling feedback submissions, or looking through old research documentation. It's also quite rare that I feel like I've gathered *enough* research to confidently proclaim a true accounting of people's pain points, needs, and desires. Invariably there is only time for so much research and our customer base happens to have highly diverse use cases.

Data can help here. After identifying a pain point, it can help to *assess its magnitude* to understand whether it is the isolated request of a noisy few or a general pain point worth investing design and engineering time into.
