<p class="has-dropcap">I originally wrote this beginner's guide to graphic design for my cousin, who's recently shown interest in the field. But I thought it might also be helpful to others looking to get into graphic design, so I'm sharing a version of it here. I'm imagining this as a living document – so it's written in Notion to keep it easily maintainable.</p>

The guide covers a wide range of material at mostly surface level, attempting to gather resources and starting points to dig into graphic design further. It's the guide I wish that I had when I first started about 6 years ago.
