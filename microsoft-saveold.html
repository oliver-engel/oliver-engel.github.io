                      <p>Our response was the Trebuchet Trials: a 4th-grade STEM activity about potential and kinetic energy. Teams of three students use simple circuitry and cardstock templates to build a functioning trebuchet. By connecting an accelerometer and Arduino, students can visualize how potential energy is transformed into kinetic energy.</p>
                      <p>The activity aligns with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nextgenscience.org/">Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AkoJsHbvPNi2i9mWYk-5evzz6W3g8Cie3XpuzmnVLx4/edit?usp=sharing">costs roughly $4</a> per student.</p>

                      <p>A DIY speaker, hydroelectric turbine, genetically breeding robotic cats... our initial ideation and research aimed to expand our knowledge of the STEM education space. Concepts were developed by selecting interesting NGSS standards and devising a digital-analog experiment to teach that standard. Inspiration was also gathered from pioneers like <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/" target="_blank">Mitchel Resnick</a>, who espouses a <a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~mres/papers/constructionism-2014.pdf">constructivist</a> approach to STEM education (essentially, learning by experiencing).</p>
                      <p>We honed in on three of our ideas: a trebuchet, a speaker, and a hydroelectric turbine, and put physical and video prototypes in front of kids to get their feedback and design ideas.</p>

                          <p>We decided to move forward with the trebuchet, but to frame our design around stakeholder buy-in. We knew that the concept was engaging and educational–and also that teachers may not want to take on the risk of flying projectiles in the classroom. We needed to find a balance between the needs of teachers, students, and Microsoft Education.</p>
                          <p>We also needed to start fleshing out the digital interface–our first step was conducting a Wizard of Oz (WOZ) test to simulate the relationship between the trebuchet, sensor, and the computer.</p>

                            <p>Seconds after beginning a test, kids tried to make their projectile launch the farthest. Maybe not the best situation for a classroom environment.</p>
                            <li>Be mindful of shorter attention spans.</li>
                            <p>We initially had a paper worksheet to accompany the activity–but between the digital interface and the trebuchet itself, kids don't have the attention span to attend to all three components.</p>

                            <li>Simplify, but don't dumb down.</li>
                            <p>4th graders are remarkably intelligent–they demonstrated a clear understanding of the trebuchet mechanics and weren't afraid to ask blunt questions. Yet we found that some portions of the experiment were too laborious–we needed to simplify every aspect that wasn't materially supporting the learning objectives.</p>
