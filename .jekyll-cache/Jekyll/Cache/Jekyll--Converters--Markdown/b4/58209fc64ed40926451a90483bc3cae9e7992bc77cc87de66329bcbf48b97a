<h5>About Boundless Immigration</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.boundless.com/">Boundless Immigration</a> is an online service that helps immigrants apply for marriage-based green cards, fiancÃ© visas, and a range of other legal statuses. Customers pair with customer support and an immigration attorney and work with them over 2-3 months to prepare their application.</p>

<h6>The Challenge</h6>

<h3>Our high-touch, multi-month green card application experience took place mostly over email, leading to customer confusion &amp; dissats, high inbound email volume, and longer processing times for all customers.</h3>

<h6>The Product</h6>
<h3>I helped design a self-serve dashboard that aimed to better guide customers through the process, speed up processing times, and lower the burden on customer support.</h3>

<p>The dashboard led to a 33% decline in inbound customer support emails over the first 5 months after launch, and positive customer &amp; CS team feedback.</p>
