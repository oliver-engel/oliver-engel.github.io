<h6>About Samsara</h6>
<p><a href="https://www.samsara.com/">Samsara</a> is an enterprise hardware + software platform for connecting physical operations (like vehicles and other assets) to the cloud. I work on Safety, which is an area that uses AI dash cams and other hardware to capture events like speeding, distracted driving, and crashes.</p>

<h6>The Challenge</h6>

<h3>The Safety Score, a highly visible (and sensitive) feature of our highest-ARR product, had low adoption in customer workflows and often required heavy customer support involvement to set up properly.</h3>

<p>Safety scores are used to identify which drivers should be coached on safe driving practices, and manifest as a number between 0 and 100.</p>

<em>Scoring formulas are configurable by customers</em></p>

<h6>The Product</h6>
<h3>I designed a guided onboarding flow and settings overhaul for Safety Scoring, geared towards increasing feature adoption and reducing customer support tickets.</h3>

<p>While it’s not yet GA’d, the updates have seen relatively rapid adoption in beta as well as positive customer feedback.</p>
