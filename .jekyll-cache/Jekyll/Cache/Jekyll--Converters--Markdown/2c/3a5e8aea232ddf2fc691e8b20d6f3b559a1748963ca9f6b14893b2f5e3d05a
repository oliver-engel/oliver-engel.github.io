<h5>About Samsara</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.samsara.com/">Samsara</a> is an enterprise hardware + software platform for connecting physical operations (like vehicles and other assets) to the cloud.</p>

<h5>The Challenge</h5>

<h3>The Safety Score, a highly visible feature of our highest-ARR product, had low adoption in customer workflows and often required heavy customer support involvement to set up.</h3>

<h5>The Product</h5>
<h3>I helped design a self-serve dashboard that aimed to better guide customers through the process, speed up processing times, and lower the burden on customer support.</h3>

<p>The dashboard led to a 33% decline in inbound customer support emails over the first 5 months after launch, and positive customer &amp; CS team feedback.</p>
