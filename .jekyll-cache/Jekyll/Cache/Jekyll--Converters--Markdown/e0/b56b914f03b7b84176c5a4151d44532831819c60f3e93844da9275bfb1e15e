I"¡<h3>I love frontend!</h3>

<p>Iâ€™m by no means a professional software developer, but I do love doing front-end work. This portfolio youâ€™re browsing now was all hand coded by me, and I like making microsites as an opportunity to try out new techniques and have fun.</p>

<h3>Pinned is a bookmarking microsite</h3>

<p>I made Pinned to curate some of my favorite digital places. Developed as a static site using Jekyll, and hosted on Netlify.</p>
