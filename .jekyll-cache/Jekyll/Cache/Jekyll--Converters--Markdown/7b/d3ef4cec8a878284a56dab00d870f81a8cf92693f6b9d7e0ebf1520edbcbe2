I"ê<h3>What‚Äôs with the kits?</h3>

<p>In 2022, I started releasing free Figma Community resources for download. I‚Äôve so far released a couple relatively successfully kits, mostly focused around design systems. I choose projects to work on based on what I‚Äôm feeling most passionate about at the moment, with some plans to release additional kits for data viz UIs, map UIs, and fully-fledged design system starters.</p>

<p>Each kit is created with Figma best practices, and with an eye towards practicality in real-world design situations.</p>
