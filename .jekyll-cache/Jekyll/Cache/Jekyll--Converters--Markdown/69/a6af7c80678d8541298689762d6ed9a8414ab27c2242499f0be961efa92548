<h5>The Challenge</h5>

<h3>Our high-touch, multi-month green card application experience took place mostly over email, leading to customer confusion &amp; dissats, high inbound email volume, and longer processing times for all customers.</h3>

<h4>About Boundless</h4>

<p>Boundless is an online service that helps immigrants apply for marriage-based green cards, fianc√© visas, and a range of other legal statuses. Customers pair with customer support and an immigration attorney and work with them over about 3 months to prepare their application.</p>

<h3>I helped design a dashboard that better guides customers throughout the application process and take required actions, while reducing the burden on our customer support team.</h3>
