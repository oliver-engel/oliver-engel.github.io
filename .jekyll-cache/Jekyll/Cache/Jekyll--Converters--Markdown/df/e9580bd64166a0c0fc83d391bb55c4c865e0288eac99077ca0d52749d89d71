I"<h3>I love frontend!</h3>

<p>I’m by no means a professional software developer, but I do love doing front-end work. This portfolio you’re browsing now was all hand coded by me, and I like making microsites as an opportunity to try out new techniques and have fun.</p>

<p>Pinned is a bookmarking microsite I made to highlight some of my favorite digital places. Developed as a static site using Jekyll, and hosted on Netlify.</p>
