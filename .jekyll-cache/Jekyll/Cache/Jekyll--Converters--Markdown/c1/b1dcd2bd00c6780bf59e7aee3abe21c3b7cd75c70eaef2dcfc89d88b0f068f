I"¥<h3>Whatâ€™s with the kits?</h3>

<p>In 2022, I started releasing free Figma Community resources for download. Iâ€™ve so far released a couple relatively successfully kits, mostly focused around design systems. I choose projects to work on based on what Iâ€™m feeling most passionate about at the moment, with some plans to release additional kits for data viz UIs, map UIs, and fully-fledged design system starters.</p>

<p>Each kit is created with Figma best practices, and with an eye towards practicality in real-world design situations.</p>

<p>I use these smaller projects as a way to test out the latest &amp; greatest Figma features, as well as continually create digital assets in a way thatâ€™s helpful to other designers.</p>
