I"¿<h4>About Boundless</h4>

<p>Boundless is an online service that helps immigrants apply for marriage-based green cards, fiancÃ© visas, and a range of other legal statuses. Customers pair with customer support and an immigration attorney and work with them over about 3 months to prepare their application.</p>

<h4>My Role</h4>

<p>I worked alongside another designer through the end-to-end design process to create the first version of a holistic customer dashboard. The dashboard is now the primary means by which Boundless customers experience our service.</p>

<h4>The Challenge</h4>
<p>Like many startups, we mechanical-turkedâ€¨many of our early customersâ€™ experiences</p>

<h4>The Product</h4>
