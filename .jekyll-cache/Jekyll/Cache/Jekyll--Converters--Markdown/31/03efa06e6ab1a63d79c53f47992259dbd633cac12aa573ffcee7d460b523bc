I"s<h4>Why tables?</h4>

<p>Tables are some of the bread and butter of interface design. They also figure largely in my current role at <a href="https://samsara.com/">Samsara</a>, where Iâ€™ve learned a great deal about what goes into a high-quality table.</p>

<p>Too many design resources are optimized for visual aesthetic rather than real-world flexibility; this free UI kit aims to address some of the painpoints of actually designing tables.</p>

<p>The kit uses best practice UI construction (autolayout, responsive elements, etc.) and features a customizable design system to make designing and changing tables simple and fluid.</p>
