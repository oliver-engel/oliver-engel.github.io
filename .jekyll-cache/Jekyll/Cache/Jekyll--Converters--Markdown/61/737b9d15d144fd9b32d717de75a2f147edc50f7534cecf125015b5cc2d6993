<h5>About Samsara</h5>
<p><a href="https://www.samsara.com/">Samsara</a> is an enterprise hardware + software platform for connecting physical operations (like vehicles and other assets) to the cloud.</p>

<h5>The Challenge</h5>

<h3>The Safety Score, a highly visible (and sensitive) feature of our highest-ARR product, had low adoption in customer workflows and often required heavy customer support involvement to set up properly.</h3>

<h5>The Product</h5>
<h3>I designed a guided onboarding flow and settings overhaul for Safety Scoring, geared towards increasing feature adoption and reducing customer support tickets.</h3>

<p>While itâ€™s not yet GAâ€™d, the updates have seen relatively rapid adoption in beta as well as positive customer feedback.</p>
