I"<h4>About Boundless</h4>

<p>Boundless is an online service that helps immigrants apply for marriage-based green cards, fiancé visas, and a range of other legal statuses. Customers pair with customer support and an immigration attorney and work with them over about 3 months to prepare their application.</p>

<h5>The challenge</h5>
<h3>Our high-touch, multi-month green card application experience took place mostly over email, leading to customer confusion &amp; dissats, high inbound email volume, and longer processing times for all customers.</h3>

<h4>My Role</h4>

<p>I worked alongside another designer through the end-to-end design process to create the first version of a holistic customer dashboard.</p>

<h4>A heavily email-driven  experience</h4>
<p>Like many startups, we mechanical-turked  many of our early customers’ experiences: most of our communications with them took place over email. This led to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>• Customers experiencing 90% of the process via email, where info is often lost</li>
  <li>• Customer service unable keep up with email replies, and use massive third-party tools to track customers</li>
  <li>• No forcing function for customers to reply in a timely manner, leading to longer wait times</li>
</ul>
