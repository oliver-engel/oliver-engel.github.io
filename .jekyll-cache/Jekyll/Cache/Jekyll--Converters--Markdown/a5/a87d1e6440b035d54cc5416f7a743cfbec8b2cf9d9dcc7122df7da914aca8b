I"N<h3>Pinned: a bookmarking microsite</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/img/projects/pinned/site.png" alt="Pinned site" /></p>

<p>I made Pinned to curate some of my favorite digital places. Developed as a static site using Jekyll, and hosted on Netlify.</p>

<p>I’m by no means a professional software developer, but I do love doing front-end work. This portfolio you’re browsing now was hand coded by me, and I like making microsites as an opportunity to try out new techniques and have fun.</p>
