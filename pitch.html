            <!-- <p>We‚Äôd all like to be better public speakers. Being able to speak clearly and with confidence is highly valuable in the workplace and in daily life. But the barrier to becoming a better speaker is too currently too high. It takes time
              and money to take classes or join groups like Toastmasters, and then motivation to act on feedback and continue to practice.</p>
            <br>
           <h4>Our response</h4>
            <p>Pitch.ai is an AI public speaking assistant that uses audio and video analysis to give pointed, actionable feedback on improving a speech or presentation. By relying on automated, immediate feedback, Pitch.ai can begin to close the
              feedback loop and accelerate personal improvement. Think of it like Grammarly for public speaking.</p>
            <p>It‚Äôs geared towards corporate teams, with the goal of being offered as a digital employee benefit. Here‚Äôs how it works:</p>
            <br>
            <p class="small-header">Prepare a speech or presentation, and open up the Pitch.ai web app. Get ready to give your presentation; if you have a slide deck to reference, use the pop-out Pitch module.</h4>
            <img class="embedded-image" src="img/microsoft/mapping.jpg">

            <p class="small-header">Set up some basic parameters like speech duration or just start recording. You can be standing or sitting, just make sure you‚Äôre visible in the laptop camera.</h4>
            <img class="embedded-image" src="img/microsoft/mapping.jpg">

            <p class="small-header">While recording, Pitch can give some real-time feedback on your speech volume, which is communicated peripherally with subtle cues.</h4>
            <img class="embedded-image" src="img/microsoft/mapping.jpg">

            <p class="small-header">After finishing, Pitch spends some time analyzing the audio and video, and spits out a set of personalized statistics and actionable next steps to improve the speech.</h4>
            <img class="embedded-image" src="img/microsoft/mapping.jpg">

            <h4>Tracked metrics</h4>
            <p>The tracked metrics include body language, eye contact, speech clarity, and filler words, among others.</p>
            <br><h4>Course packs</h4>
            <p>Selecting a corporate audience made us consider features which would provide value over the long-term; a set of specific course packs (in the vein of Headspace courses) focus on specific public speaking skills, like reducing filler words and speaking with greater clarity.</p> -->

            <h1>Design process</h1>
            <h4>Concept formation</h4>
            <p>When I joined the team, a project direction was already selected; my job was to start formulating the specifics of the product. What features would we include? What user research methods should we use to learn about behaviors around public speaking? As the sole designer, I proposed and carried out data collection methods, communicated with engineers about feasibility, and worked in tandem with MBAs who were developing a business plan.</p>

            <br>
            <h4>Gauging public interest</h4>
            <p>Our first goal as a team was to gauge the desirability of our product on the market and research the competition. We set up a series of Facebook ads targeting 20-35 year old tech employees in large cities, and I helped design and code a splash page to collect email addresses from interested customers.</p>
