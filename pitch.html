      <h3>The Challenge</h3>
      <p>Public speaking is hard. It‚Äôs not easy to stand subject to a collective gaze, and it‚Äôs even harder when we hear feedback or watch a video of our performance. Acting on that feedback is just as difficult: it takes determination, a ton of
        reps, and sometimes an audience of patient friends.</p>

      <h3>The Response</h3>
      <p>Pitch.ai is an public speaking trainer that lets a user record themselves practicing, and in turn receive a set of actionable tips, data visualizations, and training course recommendations. It uses machine learning algorithms to compare
        recorded videos to a database of speeches, providing users with objective insights into their performance. </p>
      <br>
      <p>It‚Äôs designed with working professionals in mind, with the goal of being offered as an employee benefit. Think of it like a Grammarly for public speaking.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation" id="process">
        <h3>Onboarding</h3>
        <h5 class="top-space-h5">Defining my role</h5>
        <p>This was a bit different than a typical design school project; I joined a team with an already-decided product concept for an AI speaking trainer. I defined my job as formulating the specifics of the product‚Äìwhat features would we include?
          What user research methods should we use to learn about behaviors around public speaking practice?</p>

        <p>As the sole designer, I proposed and carried out data collection methods, communicated with engineers about feasibility, and worked in tandem with MBAs who were developing a business plan.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation ">
        <h3>Gauging Public Interest</h3>

        <h5 class="top-space-h5">Facebook ad campaign</h5>
        <p>Through market research, my MBA teammates identified 20 - 35 year old tech workers as an optimal target audience because of their greater likelihood of having access to digital employee benefits and their propensity to taking up new tech.
        </p>

        <p>With an audience in mind, our first goal as a team was to gauge the desirability of our product on the market. We set up a series of Facebook ads targeting 20-35 year old tech employees in large cities, and I helped design
          and code a <a href="https://pitch-ai.github.io/" target="_blank">splash page</a> to collect email addresses from interested customers.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-2 has-animation" style="align-items:center">
        <img style="width:100%" data-src="img/pitch/splash.jpg" data-action="zoom" class="lazy big-image">
        <div>
          <h5>Representing the product</h5>
          <p>I took a quick stab at what the product might look like for the sake of giving it a visual representation‚Äìthough in hindsight I think the product concept could have been better represented through an abstraction.</p>

        </div>
        <!-- <p class="caption">Screenshot of the live splash page.</p> -->
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation">
        <h5>16% of visitors signed up</h5>
        <p>A couple days of running ads garnered an 16% sign-up rate on a set of 87 site visitors‚Äìwe viewed this as a signal that there‚Äôs a desire for our type of product. We were limited on ad placement by our shoestring student budgets, but I
          also think we could have been more thoughtful with our ad copy and imagery by tailoring it to each particular market segment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="grid-1 has-animation ">
        <h3 id="#research">User and Expert Interviews</h3>
        <h5 class="top-space-h5">Reaching target users and industry professionals</h5>
        <p>I helped make a set of interview guides so that our team could collectively perform interviews and contribute to data-gathering. Other teammates performed expert interviews with HR professionals, a student resource program manager, and a
          business leader currently at the University of Washington, while I performed interviews with target users.</p>
        <!-- <p>Expert interviews helped formulate a more cohesive business plan: and led us to incorporate Headspace-esque course packs with targeted training exercises.</p> -->

        <div>
          <h5>Research questions</h5>
          <p>The interview guide was designed to learn about behaviors around public speaking: how do people practice for presentations? What tools do they use while practicing? What is their experience with receiving feedback on their performance?</p>
        </div>
      </div>
        <!-- <p style="padding-top:75px;">The most relevant design insights were:</p> -->


        <!-- <blockquote>Most practice for presentations is done with laptops and slide-decks; therefore our MVP should be a desktop web app, with a goal of later expanding to mobile to accommodate more users.</blockquote> -->

          <h3>I synthesized some actionable design insights from user interviews:</h3>

        <blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid #3F47F5">The methods and timing of presentation practice vary wildly, so our product should be supportive of diverse habits rather than prescriptive. This steered me away from integrating any sort of

        <blockquote style="border-left: 5px solid #3F47F5">People do not actively seek feedback on their public speaking skills because they would rather not hear what they did wrong‚Äìtherefore, considering the delivery of feedback is integral to
          successful reception.</blockquote>

        <h3 id="MVP">Carving Out an MVP</h3>
        <h5 class="top-space-h5">Triangulating business & research & tech</h5>
        <p>Determining MVP features was a function of a Kano survey, the abilities of our developers, and user research. Kano results indicated high desirability in voice analysis features like filler word detection (‚Äúum‚Äù, ‚Äúlike‚Äù‚Ä¶) and vocal pitch,
          as well as video analysis features like body language and eye contact.</p>
        <h5 class="top-space-h5">From pricing model to feature</h5>
        <p>A business plan also started to crystallize. From competitive analysis of similar products like Orai and Headspace, we decided to include a set of course offerings to bring users back to the product. These could be targeted exercises (on
          topics like reducing filler words, being more expressive, etc.) bundled into course packs. Due to time constraints we were unable to explore how the courses would be experienced.</p>

        <p class="caption">Pricing models developed by the business team.</p>

        <h5 class="top-space-h5">Narrowing from technical constraints</h5>
        <p>I thought that including live feedback during a presentation performance would be an interesting feature‚Äìmultiple research participants said umprompted that it would have been helpful. After discussions with developers we concluded that
          it would be too technically difficult, so we ended up tabling it.</p>

        <h3>Behavioral Prototyping</h3>
        <p>I wanted to create a Wizard of Oz (WOZ) prototype to address some of my uncertainties: how would people react to the AI‚Äôs feedback? What motivates or demotivates certain feature usage? Does the MVP demonstrate a complete and enjoyable
          experience?</p>

          <p>I had to make my case to set aside funds to pay participants. I used sketches to help explain the concept of a WOZ prototype and what I hoped to learn from it, shown here. My teammates bought in to the idea, and a few of them helped me

              <li>Remove the content feedback section. The engineers wanted to spend time developing the feature but I was able to come back with evidence that it may not be useful in the experience.</li>
              <li>Refine the phrasing of feedback to be consistently constructive and supportive.</li>
              <li>Added additional detail to the feedback content, where the technical limits allowed. This included enumerating the actual filler words used in the presentation, and adding visualizations for pacing and pitch.</li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Moving Towards Production</h2>
        <p class="gray-text">This process ended up being messier than the ideal flow from napkin sketch to polished pixels. Here‚Äôs some of the ways I attempted to communicate my vision for interaction design to the team.</p>

          <p class="gray-text">I used annotated wireframes to communicate UI concepts and interactions to the team. This wireframe was for a pop-out control panel that could give live feedback and sit on top of a slide deck. It was nixed after we decided against live
            feedback.</p>

          <h5 class="top-space-h5">Whiteboarding with devs</h5>
          <p class="gray-text">I also did my best to externalize early ideas with whiteboard sketches. I held a couple meetings where I put my ideas on a board and had developers go through and annotate, though it mostly resulted in "we don‚Äôt have the time/resources
            to do x". For actual design crit I found it easier to approach friends outside of the project, but this meant I also had to justify new decisions back to my team.</p>

        <h5>The Struggle for Realness</h5>

        <p class="gray-text">Between the initial sketches and the polished direction, I made significant changes. I struggled constantly with translating the experience I had in my mind into something that resembled a real web app. At one point I learned from a
          developer that I had been designing in the entirely wrong dimensions, which meant that the proportions of UI elements just <i>felt weird</i>. I got over this hurdle by digging into the visual rhythms and interactions of existing web apps,
          namely <a href="https://en.todoist.com/" target="_blank">Todoist</a>, <a href="https://otter.ai/" target="_blank">Otter</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">Github</a>. I used it as sort of a competitive UI analysis.</p>
        <!-- <p>I kept elements simple by limiting micro-interactions, number of pages, and simplifying the interpretive work done by the system. For the sake of the product demo, we ended up hard-coding some elements.</p> -->

          <p>The general sentiment was that there was too much going on‚Äìand there would likely be more content added with successive API integrations. I needed to make content easier to read and to accomodate more <i>types</i> of content.</p>

          <p>I responded by shifting to a navigable (by button or arrowkey) card carousel to make the feedback content more digestible and to allow for the expansion of content types over time. With more time I would‚Äôve loved to explore other ways of
            delivering feedback.</p>

        <h3>Reflecting on the Experience</h3>
        <h5 class="top-space-h5">A rewarding challenge</h5>
        <p>This was undoubtedly the most challenging project I‚Äôve yet to work on. I found myself at first struggling to communicate both the value of design and the outcomes of my work on the project. Many of my teammates had not worked with a
          designer before, so I had to find ways to explain myself; having some sort of visual material was usually the most successful way to do so.</p>
        <h5 class="top-space-h5">Broadening my practice</h5>
        <p>Though challenging, it was a breath of fresh air after working with only designers on coursework. It reinforced my agreement with Donald Sch√∂n that <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01580516" target="_blank">design is a
            reflective conversation</a> with the materials of a situation (or more simply, design is a conversation). For most of my coursework, I‚Äôd been given a series of assignments meant to drive me through the design process‚Äìbut design in the
          real world is clearly a more complex activity.</p>
        <p>Working with only my knowledge of the existing situation, I found clarity in first enumerating my unknowns and then setting a plan to uncover them. Though I wish I had more fully
          included my team in synthesizing and acting on insights‚Äìdiscussing the work with colleagues outside of the project was not always the most productive way to move forwards.</p>
        <h5 class="top-space-h5">The facets of designing</h5>
        <p>Having to concoct my own frameworks for research and design has given me a deeper appreciation for the myriad complexities (in communication, in technical feasibility, in business...) that might surface while designing; and the recognition
          that being a successful designer is premised on an ability to navigate these as facets of the design challenge itself.</p>
