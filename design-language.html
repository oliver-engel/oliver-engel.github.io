          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Design has a problem with language. The field‚Äôs fairly recent ascent into the public consciousness has meant that perceptions about and expectations of designers have been warped. I particularly discuss the language which many use to
            talk about design, the shortcomings of contemporary design education, and the importance of critically examining the impact of the perception of design on the practice of design.</p>

          <p>Drawing from both historical and contemporary examples, I argue that the appropriation of design and design terminology by corporations has rendered the practice into an over-simplified version of itself that negates its intense richness
            and intellectual rigor. And in a period of rapid technological innovation, a nuanced understanding and ability to practice design is more valuable and necessary than ever. I also argue that this appropriated rhetoric has bled into design
            education, thus reinforcing an incomplete understanding of the value of design in students entering industry by the thousands.</p>

          <p>Fire and brimstone aside, I believe there is hope for design yet‚Äìour society‚Äôs reckoning with the fallout from corporations like Facebook and Google has sparked debates on ethics, privacy, security, and many other important topics. I
            think that designers are well positioned to take on such interdisciplinary roles that grapple with issues larger than making micro-interactions and login flows; and as the language used to describe design evolves, designers will be
            expected to assume that responsibility.</p>

          <h3>Some [brief] context on design discourse</h3>

          <p>Design has a rich intellectual tradition. We might start with Christopher Alexander, who in <a href="https://monoskop.org/images/f/ff/Alexander_Christopher_Notes_on_the_Synthesis_of_Form.pdf" target="_blank">Notes on the Synthesis of Form</a> speaks of design as a collection of methods for finding ‚Äògoodness of fit‚Äô between a created form and its context. He later recognizes in a revised 1971 preface to the seminal book that his proposed methods had become the obsession of the field, and remarks that ‚Äústudy of method by itself is always barren‚Äù. Alexander saw that
            preoccupation with method as a fundamental misunderstanding of his core ideas about design.</p>

          <p><a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Design_Methods.html?id=IR7KZXa1Nl8C" target="_blank">John Chris Jones</a> takes up the mantle of discussing design methods and argues that there is some need for the continual reflective design of design methods themselves, or ‚Äúdesigning designing‚Äù. In other words, the
            existence of ‚Äúmassive, unsolved problems created by the use of man-made things‚Äù has necessitated a method for evolving methods. If design claims to solve problems, it must also reckon with the reality that problems are always evolving and
            cannot be boiled down to a singular set of steps.</p>

          <p>The complex nature of most design challenges is crystallized by <a href="http://www.sympoetic.net/Managing_Complexity/complexity_files/1973%20Rittel%20and%20Webber%20Wicked%20Problems.pdf" target="_blank">Rittel & Weber</a>, who wrote of the pervasiveness of ‚Äúwicked‚Äù and ‚Äúill-structured problems‚Äù back in 1973. Most real-world problems are tangled in a web of interacting
            forces, and solutions that are put forth in an attempt to untangle even a small part of that web can result a ripple effect which is impossible to predict or measure. The prevalence of wicked problems implicitly demands of designers an
            ability to critically consider the implications of their work, especially in high-stakes environments.</p>

          <p>We can also jump forward to 2016, to Don Norman‚Äôs "<a href="https://jnd.org/designx_a_future_path_for_design/" target="
            ">Design X</a>", where the x represents some unknown value that captures the ambiguity and complexity of designing within sociotechnical systems. His proposed approach for designers
            working in the realm of wicked problems is an incremental, interdisciplinary, and iterative suturing of design to evolving, complex situations‚Äìand like Jones in 1970, says that extant methods for design are insuffient for the task at
            hand.</p>

          <h3>Contemporary design has a language problem</h3>

          <p>In 2015, InVision released a documentary called <a href="https://www.designdisruptors.com/">Design Disruptors</a> that captured the meteoric rise of design in the public eye. More than ever before, it argues, design is solving real problems and proposing better futures, and people are
            taking notice.

            <p>Today, design is often heralded as a solution to myriad societal and business problems. Design is considered an act of disruption and change-making that empowers people to live better lives.</p>

            <p>One of the most palpable manifestations of this propaganda is the term ‚Äòdesign thinking‚Äô. The term has permeated the mainstream consciousness, and through its popularity has been warped by over-simplification. Suddenly it is not only
              taught as gospel in design programs, but is taken up by hordes of ‚Äòinnovators‚Äô as a framework for future-building.
              There‚Äôs a disctinction to be made here: professional designers are not necessarily the people who are being consumed by the propaganda that ‚Äòdesign thinking‚Äô markets itself with. The real problem with ‚Äòdesign thinking‚Äô is that it often
              betrays the complexity and interdisciplinarity of good design in favor of concocting a ‚Äò<a href="https://www.fastco
	mpany.com/90257718/ideo-breaks-its-silence-on-design-thinkings-critics" target="_blank">theater of innovation</a>‚Äô.</p>

        <div class="info-chunk has-animation writing p-space">
          <h3>On industry expectations</h3>

          <p>As design and its terminology are appropriated by businesses looking for the next cutting edge thing, expectations in industry have become warped in the process. Some stunning examples can be found with a quick search for UX and product
            design role descriptions from companies with no idea of what value designers actually bring. Recruiters <a href="https://medium.com/truthaboutdesign/terrible-ux-design-job-descriptions-or-how-to-avoid-bad-ux-design-jobs-c254ba23b7eb" target="_blank">writing description copy</a> often seek ‚Äòdesign rockstars‚Äô who want to ‚Äòcreate innovative and world-changing experiences‚Äô, ‚Äòcraft stunning
            visuals‚Äô and can also ‚Äòcode in React‚Äô.</p>

          <p>Many companies looking to get in on the design action (i.e. businesses other than the Googles and Facebooks) seem to think that hiring a designer is the catch-all solution they‚Äôve been waiting for. And design educators are sensitive to
            the expectations of industry‚Äìit is after all the goal of most higher education to churn out industry-ready grads. The language problem with design unsurprisingly drips into education.</p>

        <div class="info-chunk has-animation writing p-space">
          <h3>Design language and education</h3>

          <p>A quick browse of General Assembly‚Äôs (GA) User Experience Design courses portray a field decayed by marketing language and buzzwords. One offering is a two-hour "<a href="https://generalassemb.ly/education/intro-to-ux-design
	livestream" target="_blank">Intro to UX</a>" webinar, of which one of the promised takeaways is the ability
            ‚Äúto create a clickable prototype using InVision‚Äù. Think about it: someone‚Äôs very first introduction to the field, and they‚Äôve already been thrown into making screen prototypes‚Äìwith little to no understanding
            of why it is being done. Alexander‚Äôs call to reject blind acceptance of method falls on deaf ears.</p>

          <p>As one GA graduate remarks in a <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/design/user-exper
	ence-design" target="_blank">marketing anecdote</a>, she was able to ‚Äúintroduce design thinking to [her] organization‚Äù after a single GA course. The delusion is compounded by the plethora of two-day bootcamps and
            hackathons that promise to give attendees the tools they need to start designing. I would not trust a carpenter who learned the trade in a two-day carpenting bootcamp.</p>

          <p>The propaganda rife in design education undercuts the intense richness of the field. In the context of Rittel and Weber‚Äôs writing on wicked problems, the focus on methods seems like a severe misjudgment of design‚Äôs abilities. Focus on
            method alone reverts design to craft.</p>

          <h3>On visual design</h3>

          <p>The vocabulary of design‚Äôs language problem is also visual. A cursory glance at Dribbble reveals a design zeitgeist saturated with hollow marketing copy and glossy illustrations that depict utopian visions of what a product can offer.
            There‚Äôs a reason people talk about the ‚ÄúDribbbilisation of design‚Äù‚Äìit‚Äôs a symptom of the oversimplification of design. <a href="https://www.intercom.com
	blog/the-dribbblisation-of-design/" target="_blank">Paul Adams</a> from Intercom sums it up well:</p>

          <blockquote>‚ÄúIf product design is about solving problems for people within the constraints of a specific business, then it simply feels that many people calling themselves product/UX designers are actually practicing digital art. They are
            Artists. They are Stylists. Executing beautiful looking things, certainly an important skill, but not practising product design.‚Äù</blockquote>

        <div class="info-chunk has-animation writing p-space">
          <h3>Repercussions of over-simplification</h3>

          <p>The increasing complexity of artificial things requires a more nuanced understanding and ability to design than ever before. John Christopher Jones <a href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Design_Methods.html?id=IR7KZXa1Nl8C" target="_blank">says that</a> ‚Äúthe most obvious sign that we need better methods of designing and planning is
            the existence, in industrial countries, of massive unsolved problems created by the use of man-made things, for example traffic congestion, road accidents, urban decay, etc.‚Äù. In the following decades our technological
            systems have only exploded in complexity and interactions with one another.</p>

          <p>At the same time, new designers with overconfidence and rudimentary tools are jumping into a swamp of wicked problems, where their work has real impacts on the people who use it. A designer working on a healthcare product could quite
            literally kill someone with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/3062815/why-is-healthcare-design-so-terrible" target="
            ">poor design</a>.</p>

          <div class="info-chunk has-animation writing p-space">

          <h3>The tension between design and capitalism</h3>

          <p>I believe that at the root of design‚Äôs language problem is the appropriation of the field by corporations and its bleeding into contemporary design education. Related to this is a larger tension that exists between capital-D Design and
            the economic machinery it is mostly situated within. Take for example the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/jdh/article-abstract/1/3-4/221/400423?redirectedFrom=fulltext" target="_blank">complicated relationship</a> between industry and Germany‚Äôs Ulm School, which valued a ‚Äúcommitment to social needs‚Äù that seemed at odds with industry‚Äôs motivation to
            maximize profits.</p>

          <p>It seems that much of today‚Äôs design education and even the field itself has drifted closer to the profit-maximizing motivations of industry. This is not necessarily a bad thing: design inherently occurs within a capitalist framework,
            and so shaping the field to better fit in with existing structures seems like a necessary step to elevating the role of design in business. <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/09/design
	thinking-comes-of-age" target="_blank">Jon Kolko</a> praises the greater influence that design has in industry, as ‚Äúan organizational focus
            on design offers unique opportunities for humanizing technology and for developing emotionally resonant products and services‚Äù. Yet profit-seeking is at the same time counter to the many potential design responses that
            could affect positive change in people‚Äôs lives. And in many cases it is having real, negative impacts on people‚Äìfrom data harvesting to gentrification.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, a focus on profits means that the ‚Äòdesign process‚Äô is often cut short. Nobody has the time they need for the ideal process; I was surprised to hear from my capstone mentor at <a href="https://www.ideo.com/" target="_blank">IDEO</a> that his team usually makes something ‚Äòbased
            on a handful of interviews and a hunch‚Äô‚Äìquite a different process than what I learned in school.</p>

          <p>This is not to say that design is at fault. I think that the opposite is more true: designers are often better equipped to ‚Äòfight the good fight‚Äô in creating services that are more amenable to people‚Äôs needs and abilities. And central to
            the design practice is an ability to make the designed things actually feasible, so that they might be incorporated into daily life and serve whatever function they were meant for. Business interests are another material of the design
            situation. When one of my graduate school professors gives a demonstration of a <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/the-whiteboard-design-challenge-18349711cbde" target="_blank">whiteboarding design challenge</a> (commonly used in tech as a barometer of interviewees‚Äô design skills), his first impulse is to ask ‚Äúwhat are the revenue
            drivers of this product‚Äù?</p>

          <div class="info-chunk has-animation writing p-space" >

          <h3>A hopeful path forward</h3>

          <p>As we collectively become aware of the unethical practices of large technology companies, conversations on ethics and responsibility have taken center stage in design. At the most recent <a href="https://interaction19.ixda.org/" target="_blank">IxDA annual conference</a>, it seemed like every other
            talk professed a need to better consider the unintended consequences of design. I think there will be a shift away from the ‚Äòmove fast and break things‚Äô mantra of design and tech, towards a more considered approach that deals with the
            complexities of ethical and social issues.</p>

          <p>Only conversations can change a field, because it is through conversation that we develop the vocabulary of a practice. We probably need to ditch the term ‚Äòdesign thinking‚Äô altogether if we are to move the field forward.</p>

          <h3>Reflecting on the state of design</h3>

          <p>When an entire field is ushered into the mainstream, there is some relinquishing of control, primarily in the language that is used to talk about the field. The role and expectations of designers becomes malleable to the language which
            describes it; if companies decide that UX designers are just fancy new visual designers, that‚Äôs what students of design will end up working towards.</p>

          <p>There is a flow of influence that follows language as it drips from popular consciousness, to businesses, to educators, to students. But if language is the problem, we are already moving in the right direction by openly discussing the role and responsibility of designers today.</p>
